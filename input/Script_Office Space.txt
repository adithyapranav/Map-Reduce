How do you know that?TOMThey're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this staff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year.

Y'knowÖ I had an idea like that once.PETERReally? What was it, Tom?TOMWell, all right. It was a JumpÖ to Conclusions-mat.

And invariably, whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.SAMIRSo what did you say?PETERI never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.MICHAELNo, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to begin with. (The printer is not working) If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars.SAMIRWell, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.MICHAELSamir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you want to do.

(gets a beer) So all you have to do is avoid him ñ (peter offers him a bottle cap remover) That's all right, i got one ñ (he gets on from his pocket) The last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you should be home free then.PETERThat's a really good idea.

If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two chicks at the same time?LAWRENCEDamn straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a millionaire, I could hook that up. Chicks dig guys with money.PETERWell not all chicksÖ.LAWRENCEWell, the type that double up on a guy like me do.PETERGood point.LAWRENCENOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?PETERBesides two chicks at the same time?LAWRENCEOh yeah.PETERNothing.LAWRENCENothing, huh?PETERI would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing.LAWRENCEYou don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man.

And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk four times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels and they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline.

Peter is more relaxed.PETERThe thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't care.BOB PORTERDon't, don't care?PETERIt's a problem of motivation, all right?

I have eight different bosses right now!BOB SLYDELLI beg your pardon?PETEREight bosses.BOB SLYDELLEight?PETEREight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is not to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob, it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.BOB SLYDELLBear with me for a minute.PETEROk.BOB SLYDELLBelieve me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some kind of stock option and equity sharing program?PETERI don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice talking to be of you guys.He shakes their hands.BOB SLYDELLAbsolutely. It's all on this side of the table, trust me.PETERGood luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.BOB SLYDELLWow.Cut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall.BILLHey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -Peter walks right past him.[Scene Chotchkie's]STANJoanna? Would you come here for a moment, please?JOANNAI'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.STANI need to talk about your flair.JOANNAReally? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows himSTANWell, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?JOANNAOk.STANNow, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a terrific smile.JOANNAOk. Ok, you want me to wear more?STANLook. Joanna.JOANNAYeah.STANPeople can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's for the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about. It's about fun.JOANNAOk. So, more then?STANLook, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?JOANNAYeah. Yeah.STANGreat. Great. That's all I ask.JOANNAOk.[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.]BOB SLYDELLRight. So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom Smykowski.BILLHe's useless.BOB SLYDELLGone.DOMSounds good to me.BOB SLYDELLHere's a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.DOMWho's he?BOBYou know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.DOMOh.BOB SLYDELLWe can't find a record of him being a current employee here.BOB PORTERI looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed off about five years ago and no one ever told him about it. But through a glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed the glitch.BILLGreat.DOMSo, um, Milton has been let go.BOB SLYDELLJust a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he won't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out naturally.BOB PORTERWe always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is solved from here on, then.They laugh.BOB SLYDELLUh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this young man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all over him.BILLOoh, uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that he's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having some problems with his TPS reports.BOB PORTERI'll handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.BOB SLYDELLUm-um.BOB PORTERIt's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really motivated.BOB SLYDELLThere it is.BILLYeah, I'm not sure about that now.BOB PORTERAll right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you say you deal with these TPS reports?BILLYeah...[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He takes a drill and removes the metal door handle.]Cut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot.Cut back inside. Peter tears down the banner.Cut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to pull off the bumper.Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss.LAWRENCEHey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!Cut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not there.Cut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a big fish.Cut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler.DOMHello, Peter.PETERHey Dom!He slaps him on the back.Cut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut it. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports.Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu.Cut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it over. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes.[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as Bill walks up.]BILLSo, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have those TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh, yeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, hmm?PETERNot right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.BILLUh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.PETERYeah, they called me at home.BILLThat sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all fixed up for you later.[Scene Milton's cubicle. He's organizing papers.]MILTONF...C...P...BILLHi, Milton. What's going on?MILTONI, I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.BILLUh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.MILTONI, I did and they, and they said -BILLUh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.MILTONNo...I...I...BILLUh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can get.MILTONNo...no...no...no...but...but...but...I, I, I -BILLAnd if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care of the roach problem we've been having that would be great. (He walks away.MILTONI can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?[Scene The meeting between Peter and the two Bobs.]BOB PORTERIt looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.PETERI wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.They laugh.BOB SLYDELLThat's terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some of the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a little (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people.PETERWell, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.BOB PORTERWell, these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...BOB SLYDELLNaga...BOB PORTERNaga-worker here anyway!The Bobs laugh.BOB SLYDELLMr. Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.PETERYou're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?BOB PORTERWe're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in Singapore, that's the usual deal.BOB SLYDELLWell, it's standard operating procedure.PETERDo they know about this yet?BOB SLYDELLNo! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a Friday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an incident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as many as four people working right underneath you.BOB PORTERThis is a big promotion, Pete.BOB SLYDELLHuge.PETERSo you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?BOB SLYDELLUmm-hmm.PETERWow![Scene Michael is messing with the printer.]MICHAELYeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-Peter walks up to him.PETERListen... Well, what are you doing tonight?[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]PETERThere comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.MICHAELUh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're the one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious experience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or you're gonna get canned.PETERYeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...MICHAELYeah? What about it?PETERWell, how does it work?MICHAELIt's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it takes those remainders and puts it into your account.PETERThis sounds familiar.MICHAELYeah. They did this in Superman III.PETERYeah. What a good movie.MICHAELA bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.PETERWell, so they check for this now?MICHAELNo, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're updating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.PETERYou're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all that code.MICHAELIt's numbers up their asses.PETERSo, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?MICHAELIt's not worth the risk. I got a good job.PETERWhat if you didn't have a good job?[Scene A bar. Michael and Peter are there.]MICHAELCockos! Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you, you haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job.PETERActually, I'm being promoted.MICHAELWhat?!!!PETERYeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something today. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all of us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the other day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't have a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this way. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.MICHAELI told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.PETERthat is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing or something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go in tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know why? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael, let's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software works right?MICHAELOf course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work, I don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software loan.PETERYeah? But Samir does.[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]SAMIRBut that's not much money, I -PETERThat's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent. That's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it out over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.MICHAELJust like Superman III.SAMIRSuperman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to get my resume ready.PETERGet your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for no reason?SAMIRThat's right! If I'm lucky.PETERLook, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed around. Aren't you?SAMIRYes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.PETERIllegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have conjugal visits there?SAMIRReally.PETERYes.MICHAELShit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.SAMIRSo what do you think?MICHAELThis thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.PETERYou came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock of that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two optionsunemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?SAMIRI have a question.PETERYes.SAMIRIn, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?PETERYep. You sure can.SAMIROk. I'm gonna do it.PETERThat's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!MICHAELPeter Let's discuss the plan, all right?PETERAll right.MICHAELAll right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the rest.PETEROk, you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but listen. Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God, Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no girlfriends, nobody!SAMIROf course.MICHAELAgreed.LAWRENCEDon't worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!MICHAELWho the fuck is that?!PETERUh, don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see it all going down...[Scene Initech. Peter shakes the Bobs' hands.]BOB SLYDELLPeter, congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.BOB PORTERAnd we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away. (They give a thumbs up.[Scene Samir and Michael's cubicle. They look at each other. Michael copies the virus and looks around. He gives it to Samir. Samir walks by Peter and gives it to him. He puts it into his computer and copies the file. He goes to Samir and Michael's cubicle.]MICHAELWell, that was easy.PETERYeah, I guess it was.MICHAELWhat did you do with the -DREWHey guys.PETEROh, hey Drew.DREWdid you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?MICHAELThe guy who got laid off?DREWNo, man, check this out.[Flashback. Tom's getting drunk in his kitchen.]DREWV/O) LAST WEEK, AFTER HE FOUND OUT HE WAS GETTING LAID OFF, HE TRIES TO KILL HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE CAR IN THE GARAGE.Cut to Tom in his car.MICHAELV/O) IS HE DEAD?!DREWV/O) BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND HIM IN THE CAR AND TRIES TO PLAY IT OFF AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.TOMCOUGH) I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE. IT'S JAMMED. I, I COULDN'T GET IT INTO DRIVE. I, I, I MEAN, REVERSE.MRS. SMYKOWSKIAre you ok, Tom?TOMYeah.DREWV/O) AND THEN, AS HE'S LOOKING AT HER, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO LIVE.TOMI'm ok.MRS.

He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his back. But check it out. He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this. Like seven figures. He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and he's throwing a big party to celebrate. I'm thinking I'm gonna take that new chick from Logistics. I might be showing her my O face. Oh! Oh! Oh! you know what I'm talking about. Oh! Yeah. Right. See you guys there.[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael are with him.]MICHAELWow, our last day at Initech.SAMIRI can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna steal something.PETERI stole something.MICHAELOh yeah. I guess we all did.PETERNo, I stole something else.SAMIRWhat did you steal?PETERWe'll call it a going away present.[Scene A field. They drop the printer. Samir stomps on it four times and Michael, eight times. Peter hands Samir a bat. He hits the printer twice and Michael takes over. He starts to punch it. Samir and Peter pull him away, but he runs back to destroy the evil printer.]Cut to Peter's place. Samir's trying to break dance.[Scene Outside Peter's place.]PETEREverything is going to be ok. Ok?SAMIRThe one I see is -PETERI can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over. Don't worry! You're worrying! All right? Monday morning we're gonna check the account balance and everything will be all right. Don't miss Tom's barbecue. I'll see you there.Peter goes inside.SAMIRRAPPING) BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...[Scene Peter's place, morning. Joanna sees all the empty liquor bottles.]JOANNAHey, what were you guys celebrating last night?PETERUm, I'm not really at liberty to talk about it. I really can't.[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are going to the barbecue.]PETERSo when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these extra decimals places that just get rounded off. So we just simplify the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into an account that we own.JOANNASo you're stealing.PETERAh, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh, it's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh, over time, they add up to a lot.JOANNAOk. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?PETERYeah.JOANNAOk. That's not yours?PETERWell, it, it becomes ours.JOANNAHow's that not stealing?PETERI don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this Seven Eleven, right? If you take a penny from the tray -JOANNAFrom the crippled children?!PETERNo, that's the tray. I'm talking about the tray. The penny's for everybody.JOANNAOh, for everybody. Ok.PETERYeah, well, those are whole pennies.JOANNAYeah.PETERRight. I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it from a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong with that?JOANNAIt seems wrong.PETERIt's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all right? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get up in the morning and put on pieces of flair?JOANNAYeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the register!PETERYou know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear them.JOANNAWhat?!PETERLook, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go to the barbecue, all right?JOANNAOk.[Scene Tom's house. Samir and Michael open the front door. tom is in a full body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff.]TOMMichael! Samir! How are you doing?MICHAELHiya Tom.SAMIRHi Tom.TOMYeah, I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands) Rob, Michael.ROBHello Michael.TOMSamir.ROBHello -SAMIRSamir.ROB...Samir.

On the bottom are footprints, under the word StartTOMWell, what do you think? It's a prototype.PETERWell, that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about your settlement. Congratulations.TOMWell, thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to talk to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I just wanted you to know that's how you feel. I used to be the same way.PETERReally?TOMSure. Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as you and I've been doing good for over thirty years!PETERWow.TOMJust rememberIf you hang in there long enough, good things can happen. I mean, look at me.He laughs.PETERThanks Tom.TOMAw, sure.[Scene The backyard. Samir and Michael are talking to Rob.]ROBConjugal visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is no picnic. I have a client in there right now. You see, the trick is, kick someone's ass the first day or become someone's bitch. Then everything will be all right. Why do you ask, anyway?MICHAELOh, no, we were just seeing -His cup flies out of his hand and ice cubes go everywhere.Cut to Peter and Drew.DREWHey Peter.PETERDrew.DREWThat's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh?PETERYeah.DREWLucky bastard.

I didn't ask you who you slept with before we were together. I don't care!PETERWell, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!JOANNAListen to you! Who do you think you are? How dare you judge! Do you think you're an angel or something? No! You're this petty, stealing, wannabe criminal...man!PETERWell, I may be. But at least I never slept with Lumbergh!!JOANNAOk. That's it. I'm done. I want to get out of the car. Stop. I wanna get -PETERFine.He stops and Joanna gets out.JOANNAWhy don't you call me when you grow up?

Uh, could you give me those TPS reports ASAP? Mmmkay?Peter wakes up and breathes deeply.[Scene Chotchkie's. Stan approaches Joanna.]STANJoanna?JOANNAYeah?STANWe need to talk. Do you know what this is about?JOANNAMy, uh, flair.STANYeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I'm counting and I only see fifteen pieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna.JOANNAUmm-hmm.STANWhat do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum?JOANNAHuh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of flair?STANWell, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself.JOANNAYeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the finger) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself.

Ok!SAMIROk?!MICHAELOk! Ok! I must have, I must have put a decimal point in the wrong place or something. Shit. I always do that. I always mess up some mundane detail.PETEROh! What is this fairly mundane detail, Michael?!!!!!MICHAELOk quit getting pissed at me, all right? This was all your idea, asshole.PETERAll right. Ok. All right. Let's try not to get pissed off at each other, all right? We'll figure this thing out together, ok? And the first thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it gets any bigger.[Scene Initech. It's Bill's 41st birthday. All the employees are singing the birthday song to him in a flat monotone. He blows out the candles and everyone claps.]ALLMmm. You look terrific.

Milton has to watch everyone enjoy their piece.[Scene Peter's apartment. They're trying to figure out what to do.]SAMIRIs, is there a way to just give the money back?PETERWhat? We just hand them a check with the exact amount they're missing? I, I think they'd figure that out.SAMIRWell, we have to do something.MICHAELMay-maybe we launder the money.PETERThat's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that?MICHAELI don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's something I think, I think coke dealers do.PETEROk. Do we know any coke dealers?MICHAELMy, my cousin's a cokehead. We're in deep shit.SAMIRYes. We are in very, very deep shit.[Scene Milton's new "office" - the basement. Bill enters with a piece of cake.]BILLMilton?MILTONYes.BILLWhat's happening?MILTONI wanted to see you because -BILLSay, you know what would be a great idea?MILTONNo...no.BILLSince you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having in here.MILTONI...I...that's really not my job and I haven't received my -BILLFor now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and -Dom enters.DOMBill!

If we had more experience -MICHAELNo. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence all over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder money, I wouldn't want to.

I had no right to get pissed off at you, Lumbergh isn't my problem. It wasn't even the right Lumbergh. I don't know why I can't just go to work and be happy, like I'm supposed to like everybody else.JOANNAPeter, most people don't like their jobs. But you go out there and find something that makes you happy.PETERYeah. I may never be happy with my job. But if I could be with you, I think that I could be happy with my life.
