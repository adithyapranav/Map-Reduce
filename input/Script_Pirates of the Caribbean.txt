FADE IN:EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAYA gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes theFAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo,almost under her breath.                     YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)           Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me           Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life           for me...Suddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the WingedVictory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought,the H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-fivegun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot.EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAYELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bowrailing, gazing at the seas, still singing --                     ELIZABETH           ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...JOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather,clutches her shoulder, startling her.                     GIBBS               (sotto)           Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail           these waters. You want to call           'em down on us?Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him.                        NORRINGTON           Mr. Gibbs.NORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core,glares sternly at Gibbs. Standing besides him is GOVERNORWEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brassbuttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth'sfather.                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)           That will do.                    GIBBS          She was singing about pirates.          Bad luck to sing about pirates,          with us mired in this unnatural          fog-- mark my words.                    NORRINGTON          Consider them marked.   On your          way.                    GIBBS          'Aye, Captain.              (as he moves off)          Bad luck to have a woman on board,          too. Even a mini'ture one.He returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiouslytakes a quick swig from flask.                    ELIZABETH          I think it would be rather          exciting to meet a pirate.                    NORRINGTON          Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and          dissolute creatures, the  lot of          them. I intend to see to   it that          any man who sails under a  pirate          flag, or wears a pirates  brand,          gets what he deserves: a  short          drop and a sudden stop.Elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a suddenstop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.                    SWAN          Captain Norrington... I appreciate          your fervor, but I am concerned about          the effect this subject will have on          my daughter.                    NORRINGTON          My apologies, Governor.                    ELIZABETH          Actually, I find it all fascinating.                    SWAN          And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth,          dear... we will be landing in Port          Royal very soon, and beginning our new          lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we          comport ourselves as befits our class          and station?                    ELIZABETH          Yes, father.Chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)              (to herself)          I still think it would be exciting          to meet a pirate...The fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea isvisible ---- but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy,WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise emptywater. There is nothing to show where he came from, or howhe came to be there.                     ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          Look!   A boy! In the water!Norrington and Swann spot him --                    NORRINGTON          Man overboard!                    ELIZABETH          Boy overboard!                    NORRINGTON          Fetch a hook! Haul him out of          there!Quick movement and activity on the deck. Sailors use aboathook to snag the boy he the passes. Norrington andSwann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabethsidles in for a closer look.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          He's still breathing.                     SWAN          Where did he come from?                    GIBBS          Mary mother of God ...Attention is turned away from the boy --The sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship littersthe water... along with the bodies of its crew. What isleft of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flaghanging limply from the stern.The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all.   Thescene calls for hushed voices.                    SWAN          What happened here?                    NORRINGTON          An explosion in the powder magazine.          Merchant vessels run heavily armed.                    GIBBS          Lot of good it did them...              (off Swan's look)          Everyone's thinking it! I'm just          saying it! Pirates!                    SWAN          There is no proof of that. It could          have been an accident. Captain, these          men were protection. If there is even          the slightest chance one of those poor          devils is still alive, we cannot          abandon them!                     NORRINGTON          Of course not, Governor.              (to the crew)          Come about and strike the sails! Unlash          the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off          the cannons!              (to Swann)          Hope for the best...prepare for          the worst.              (to two sailors)          Move the boy aft. We'll need the          deck clear.They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from therail, away from the hideous scene in the water.                    SWAN          Elizabeth, I want you to accompany          the boy. He's in your charge now.          You'll watch over him?Elizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstowthe longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poopdeck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. Elizabeth kneelsdown besides the boy.His good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out,gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth isstartled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.                    ELIZABETH          My name is Elizabeth Swann.                    WILL          Will Turner.                    ELIZABETH          I'm watching over you, Will.He clutches her hands, then slips back intounconsciousness.His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabethsees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free,revealing--A GOLD MEDALLION.   One side is blank.   She turns it over --A SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but toher eyes, it means one thing only:                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          You're a pirate.She glances back at the crew.   Sees Norrington, givingorders, moving toward her.She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takesthe medallion from around his neck. Hides it under hercoat.Norrington arrives.                    NORRINGTON          Did he speak?                    ELIZABETH          His name is Will Turner -- that's          all I found out.                       NORRINGTON          Very good.Norrington hurries off. Elizabeth steals away to the sternof the ship. Examines her prize -- the gold medallion. Awisp of wind, and she looks up --Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as aghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --It has BLACK SAILS.Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but notthe mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skulland crossbones of the Jolly Roger.Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull onthe flag is the same as the one on the medallion.Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except forthe black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears toTURN and GRIN at her --Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --                       EIGHT YEARS LATERINT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing onthe stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-oldElizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.She remains motionless (were the images we just saw anightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes aspossible without moving. Might there be someone in theroom with her, looming over her?She turns, ready for anything.   She is alone.Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lampbesides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across theroom to a dressing table, sits down.She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reachesinto a space beneath it and removes --The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has notlost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at itas she absently returns the draw to its place --A BOOMING knock on the door;    Elizabeth jumps up, startledknocking over her chair.                    SWANN (O.S.)          Elizabeth? Is everything all          right? Are you decent?                    ELIZABETH          Yes -- yes.She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown asSwann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid,ESTRELLA, follows.                    SWANN          Still abed at this hour?    It's a          beautiful day!Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL,built on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of theharbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined withcannon.                    SWANN (CONT'D)          I have a gift for you.He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvetdress. She lets out an admiring gasp.                    ELIZABETH          It's -- beautiful. May I inquire          as to the occasion?                    SWANN          Is an occasion necessary for a father          to dote upon his daughter with gifts?Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened-off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.                    SWANN (CONT'D)          Although...I did think you could          wear it to the ceremony today.                       ELIZABETH (O.S.)          Ceremony?                    SWANN          Captain Norrington's promotion          ceremony.Elizabeth peeks around the screen.                       ELIZABETH          I knew it.                    SWANN          Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a          fine gentleman, don't you think?              (no answer)          He fancies you, you know.Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.                       SWANN (CONT'D)          Elizabeth?     How's it coming?ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and      the medallion (stillaround her neck) out of the way as the      maid cinches herinto a corset over her slip. Estrella       has her foot inElizabeth's back as she pulls the laces      tight.                    ELIZABETH          Difficult ... to say.                    SWANN (O.S.)          I'm told that dress is the very latest          fashion in London.                    ELIZABETH              (holding her breath)          Women in London must have learned to          not breath.Estrella is finished.   Elizabeth takes a breath -- andwinces.A butler appears in the doorway of the room.                    BUTLER          Governor? A caller is here for          you.INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAYThe caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer,looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a longpresentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots onthe back of his calves, but it doesn't help.                     SWANN          Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see          you again!The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with awatchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.                    WILL          Good day, sir.              (holds out the case)          I have your order.Swann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is abeautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it outreverently.                    WILL (CONT'D)                    WILL (CONT'D)          The blade is folded steel. That's          gold filigree laid into the          handle. If I may -He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on onefinger at the point where the blade meets the guard.                    WILL (CONT'D)          Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly          the full width of the blade..                    SWANN          Impressive. .. very impressive.          Commodore Norrington will be pleased,          I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to          your master.Will's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he isproud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the swordaround, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.                    WILL              (bows slightly)          I shall. A craftsman is always pleased          to hear his work is appreciated --He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann -Elizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may bepainful to wear, but holy smokes!                    SWANN          Elizabeth! You look stunning!Will tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles tohimself, and simply nods emphatically.                    ELIZABETH          Will! It's so good to see you!Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallionis hidden in the bodice of her dress).                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          I dreamt about you last night.          Will reacts with surprise:          "Really?                    SWANN          Elizabeth, this is hardly          appropriate -                    ELIZABETH              (ignores her father)          About the day we met. Do you          remember?                    WILL          I could never forget it, Miss          Swann.                    ELIZABETH          Will, how many times must I ask          you to call me 'Elizabeth'?                    WILL          At least once more, Miss Swann. As          always.Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by hisresponse.                    SWANN          Well said! There's a boy who          understands propriety. Now, we must be          going.Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door forElizabeth.Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts andstrides past Will.                    ELIZABETH          Good day, Mr. Turner.EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAYSwann follows Elizabeth out the door.                      WILL          Good day.He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by thedriver.                     WILL (CONT'D)              (to himself)          Elizabeth.IN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.                    SWANN          Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit          more decorum in front of Commodore          Norrington. After all, it is only          through his efforts that Port Royal has          become at all civilized.EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAYThe skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad inbuccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rockypromontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing asign:PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front ofthem. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high inthe rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbucklingrogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises atankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches hisattention. He jumps from the rigging --- and that's when we see that his is ship is not animposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with asingle sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.And it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet tocontrol the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around thepromontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.The huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominatesthe bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: theH.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns anda mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up atthe Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below FortCharles.EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAYSmoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down thesail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. TheHARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is thereto catch a line and help Jack tie up.                    HARBORMASTER          If you're out rolling scuppers in          this tub, you're either incredibly          brave or incredibly stupid.                    JACK          It's remarkable how often those          two traits coincide.He starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besidesthe scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and smallpowder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off.                    HARBORMASTER          It's a shilling for the dock          space, and you're going to have to          give me your name.                    JACK          What do you say to three          shillings, and we forget the name?He tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormasterconsiders, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.                    HARBORMASTER          Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks acrossthe water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above theInterceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremonyis underway -EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAYWith choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword andscabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformedNavy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds itout vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, andSwann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes thesword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swannsteps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, stepsback.Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellowofficers, turns again and nods to the audience -dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping fromthe Navy men.In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, outbeneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces.Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the materialof the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide herdiscomfort.EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAYTwo sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, takeadvantage of what little shade there is on the dock. Butwhen Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.                     MURTOGG          This dock is off-limits to          civilians.                    JACK          Sorry, I didn't know.Music drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shieldshis eyes.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?          You two weren't invited?                     MURTOGG          No ... someone has to make sure          this dock stays off-limits to          civilians.                    JACK          This must be some important boat.                       MULLROY          Ship.                       JACK          Ship.                    MURTOGG          Captain Norrington's made it his          flagship. He'll use it to hunt          down the last dregs of piracy on          the Spanish Lake.                       MULLROY          Commodore.                    MURTOGG          Right. Commodore Norrington.                    JACK          That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it          seems to me a ship like that --              (indicates the Dauntless)          -- makes this one here just a wee          superfluous.                    MURTOGG          Oh, the Dauntless is the power in          these waters, true enough -- but          there's no ship that can match the          Interceptor for speed.                    JACK          That so? I've heard of one, supposed to          be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black          Pearl?Mullroy scoffs at the name.                    MULLR0Y          There's no real ship as can match          the Interceptor.                    MURTOGG          The Black Pearl is a real ship.                    MULLROY          No, it's not.                    MURTOGG          Yes it is. I've seen it.                    MULLR0Y          You've seen it?                    MURTOGG          Yes.                    MULLROY          You've seen the Black Pearl?                    MURTOGG          Yes.                    MULLR0Y          You haven't seen it.                    MURTOGG          Yes, I have.                    MULLR0Y          You've seen a ship with black sails          that's crewed by the damned and          captained by a man so evil that hell          itself spat him back out?                     MURTOGG          ... No .                     MULLROY          No.                    MURTOGG          But I've seen a ship with black sails.                    MULLR0Y          Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by          the damned and captained by a man so          evil hell itself spat him back out          could possibly have black sails and          therefore couldn't possibly be any ship          other than the Black Pearl. Is that          what you're saying?                     MURTOGG          ... no.                    MULLR0Y              (turns back to Jack)          Like I said, there's no real ship          as can match -- Hey!But Jack's not there. Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot-Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casuallyexamining the mechanism.                     MULLROY (CONT'D)          You!Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. Thesailors hurry toward the gangplank.                    MULLROY (CONT'D)          Get away from there! You don't          have permission to be aboard          there!Jack spreads his hands in apology.                    JACK          I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty          boat. Ship.The sailors study him suspiciously.                    MURTOGG          What's your name?                       JACK          Smith.                    MULLR0Y          What's your business in Port          Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?                    MURTOGG          And no lies!                    JACK          None? Very well. You've rumbled          me. I confess: I intend to          commandeer one of these ships,          pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go          out on the account, do a little          honest pirating.                    MURTOGG          I said, no lies.                    MULLR0Y          I think he's telling the truth.                    MURTOGG          He's not telling the truth.                       MULLROY          He may be.                    MURTOGG          If he were telling the truth he          wouldn't have told us.                    JACK          Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't          believe the truth if he told it to you.Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAYElizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly,oblivious to the music and chatter.                    NORRINGTON          May I have a moment?He extends his arm. She takes it. He walks her away fromthe party, toward the parapet. A rather too long of asilence as Norrington works up his courage.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)              (a burst)          You look lovely. Elizabeth.Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus. Norrington mistakes herexpression as disapproval.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          I apologize if I seem forward --          but I must speak my mind.                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)              (working up his               confidence to do so)          This promotion confirms that I have          accomplished the goals I set for myself          in my career. But it also casts into          sharp relief that which I have not          achieved. The thing all men most          require: a marriage to a fine woman.              (beat)          You have become a fine woman,          Elizabeth.                    ELIZABETH          I can't breathe.                    NORRINGTON              (smiles)          I'm a bit nervous, myself --Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington.She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself,but it slides off --- and then she vanishes over the wall. Gone.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          Elizabeth! .EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAYJack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see -Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff. It seems totake her a long time to reach the sea --Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks.A wave breaks, and then she is washed out away from thecliff, struggling feebly.AT THE FORT, Norrington looks down --NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive -- alieutenant, GILLETTE catches his arm.                    GILLETTE          The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she          missed them!Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down -- and realizesGillette is right. He jumps down and runs --EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAYJack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from thesight.                    JACK          Aren't you going to save her?                    MULLR0Y          I can't swim.Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he.                    JACK              (rolls his eyes)          Sailors.Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water. Norringtonand several other men pick their way down the cliffs. Theyare too far away to get to her in time.Jack scowls. He has no choice -- and it pisses him off.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Fine.He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg;then hands the belt to Mullroy.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Don't lose these.And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth.Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air '-then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged -UNDERWATER, Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious. The currentturns her, and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice.The MEDALLION turns slowly, until the SKULL is fullyvisible. A shaft of filtered sunlight hits it, and itGLINTS -EXT. PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAYFORT CHARLES: The British flag flies, blown from anoffshore breeze. Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goeslimp.ON THE DOCKS: Wood and metal fittings on lines bang againstmasts. The wind dies, and there is silence.ON THE EDGE OF TOWN: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds cluckingchickens, frowns when they all suddenly go quiet ...IN THE VILLAGE: A weather vane moves slightly in the wind.The wind stops, and all is still. And then ...... the weather vane TURNS, and holds steady -- the windhas picked up again, but now blows .from the sea toward theland.l)ON THE BEACH: an OLD SALT pulls a rope line, pauses.Turns and gazes to the sky, frowning. The mangy hound athis side starts BARKING incessantly -ON THE DOCKS: The lines bang against the other sides of themasts, the wind far stronger now.FORT CHARLES: the British flag flies in the oppositedirection, snapping in the new onshore breeze.EXT. PORT ROYAL - CLIFFSIDE - DAYNorrington rushes down, intent on the climb. Beyond him,past the rocky point, far out to sea, FOG gathers -EXT. PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAYUNDERWATER: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmovingform - - and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around herand makes for the surface.ON THE SURFACE, Jack swims toward the dock, struggling. Itis .: far more difficult than it should be. He stopsstroking, and they submerge.UNDERWATER: Jack realizes that   it is Elizabeth's heavyvelvet dress that is weighing   them down. He pulls at thebuttons on the back, and they   give way. He skins her out ofthe dress, and kicks away from   it.The dress falls like a cloud into darkness -ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much morequickly.AT THE DOCK, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haulElizabeth out of the water.Jack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth is on her back;Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them.Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth.                    MULLROY          Not breathing.Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless. Jack steps up,drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath.                    JACK          Move.He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises theknife -- Murtogg is shocked -Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away.Elizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up waterand gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack isrelieved.                    MULLROY          I never would have thought of          that.                     JACK          Clearly, you've never been to          Singapore.Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -and that's when he spots -The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his "hand.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Where did you get this?Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is atJack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, infact, looking bright and sharp.                    NORRINGTON          On your feet.It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of herclothes gone. He gets to his feet. The rest of Elizabeth'serstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann.                    SWANN          Elizabeth! Are you all right?He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her.                    ELIZABETH          Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore          Norrington, do you intend to kill          my rescuer?Norrington looks at Jack. Jack nods as best he can with ablade beneath his chin. Norrington sheathes his sword, andextends his hand.                    NORRINGTON          I believe thanks are in order.Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly. They shake --- and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's armtoward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt --- exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.'                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          Had a brush-up with the East India          Trading Company, did you ... pirate?The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained--in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack. Hestands there, still holding the corset.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette,          fetch some irons.Norrington notices something else -- below the 'P' brand isa tattoo: a small bird in flight across water.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?                    JACK          Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.Norrington looks out at the bay.                    NORRINGTON          I don't see your ship -- Captain.                    MURTOGG          He said he'd come to commandeer one.                    MULLROY              (to Murtogg)          I told you he was telling the truth.              (currying favor)          These are his, sir.He holds out Jack's pistol and belt. Norrington takes thepistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt.                    NORRINGTON              (to Jack)          Extra powder, but no additional shot.Jack shrugs. Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt,opens it. He frowns at the reading. Moves the compass thisway and that, keeping it parallel to the ground.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          It doesn't bear true.Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns thecompass to the belt. Draws the sword half from thescabbard.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          I half-expected it to be made of wood.He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          Taking stock: you've got a pistol with          only one shot, a compass that doesn't          point north ... and no ship. You are          without a doubt the worst pirate I have          ever heard of.                    JACK          Ah, but you have heard of me.Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack.                    NORRINGTON          Carefully, lieutenant.Elizabeth steps forward. Swann's jacket slips off her. Sheis unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her.                    ELIZABETH          Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or          not, this man saved my life.                    NORRINGTON          One good deed is not enough to redeem a          man of a lifetime of wickedness.Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists.                    JACK          But it seems to be enough to condemn          him.                    NORRINGTON              (smiles)          Indeed.Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to hismen. All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward -                       JACK          Finally.Lightning-quick, he snaps the   corset  around the hand andwrist of the man holding the   pistol  and yanks. The pistolsails into the water. Before   anyone  can react to that, Jackhas the manacle chain wrapped   around  Elizabeth's throat.Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as ashield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.                    JACK (CONT'D)              (backing away, toward land)          Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and          belt, please.Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.                       JACK (CONT'D)          Commodore!Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norringtonholds them out to Jack.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?Elizabeth is more angry than frightened.ELIZABETH Miss Swann.                    JACK          Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack'squicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. Hejerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Now, if you'll be very kind?She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.                    ELIZABETH              (as she works)          You are despicable.                    JACK          I saved your life; now you've          saved mine. We're square.Done. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumpsagainst the cargo gantry.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will          always remember this as the day          you almost caught Captain Jack          Sparrow.He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free abelaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted upto the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope -Pistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, awayand around from the gantry.Norrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracksJack's trajectory-Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shottears the rope --- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, hesnaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabshold of the far loop -- slides down the line --- drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to anothership, then out of sight -                    NORRINGTON          On his heels! Gillette, bring a          squad down from the fort!              (to Elizabeth)          Elizabeth, are you -                    ELIZABETH          Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go          capture him.Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurriesaway. Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.                    SWANN          Here, dear ... you should wear this.Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold.Glances out at the bay --- where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water. Shetakes the jacket.                    ELIZABETH          Thank you, Father ... and let that          be the last of your fashion          advice, please.But she accepts his comforting embrace.EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAYThe fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. Anarmed search party moves along the street. They glance downan alley-On the far side is another search party. The men nod toeach other, continue on.A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneaththe eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles.Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thrudoor set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil.INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAYJack slips in through the door, takes a look around:No windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in-progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought irongates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But everytool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat.Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in ablacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling abottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,turns away.Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handledsledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowingcoke furnace in the middle of the room.Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, thechain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jacksweats, grimaces at the pain -Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of ananvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke onthe glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steambillows.Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneaththe manacle -- but his hands are free.The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots thedrunken Mister Brown in the corner.                    WILL          Right where I left you.Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. Thesledge lying beside the anvil.                    WILL (CONT'D)              (under his breath)          Not where I left you.He moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it --but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumpsback.Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up,toward the door. Will glares at him.                    WILL (CONT' D)              (voice low and tight)          You're the one they're hunting.          The pirate.Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... thenfrowns, regards Will.                    JACK          You look familiar ... Have I ever          threatened you before?                    WILL          I've made a point of avoiding          familiarity with pirates.                    JACK          Ah. Then it would be a shame to          put a black mark on your record.          So if you'll excuse me ...Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting inthe honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has itin hand.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Do you think this is wise, boy?          Crossing blades with a pirate?                    WILL          You threatened Miss Swann.                    JACK          Only a little.In response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jackappraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, tradingfeints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almostimpossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.                    JACK (CONT'D)          You know what you're doing, I'll          give you that ... Excellent form          ... But how's your footwork? If I          step here -He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps theother way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Very good! And if I step again,          you step again. . .              (continuing to step               around the circle)          And so we circle, circle, like          dogs we circle. . .They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Ta!Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a viciousoverhand motion, he throws his sword --- the sword buries itself into the door, just above thelatch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pullson the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in theway.Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- itis really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when heturns back to Will, he's smiling.                    JACK (CONT' D)          That's a good trick. Except, once          again, you are between me and the          way out.              (points his sword at the               back door)          And now you have no weapon.Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from ananvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward.Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly,Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand atWill's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarminghim.Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes awarethat the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords,knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Who makes all these?                    WILL          I do. And I practice with them. At          least three hours a day.                    JACK          You need to find yourself a girl.              (Will sets his jaw)          Or maybe the reason you practice          three hours a day is you've found          one -- but can't get her?A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly withanger.                    WILL          No. I practice three hours a day          so that when I meet a pirate ... I          can kill him.He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into hishand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into theair, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.Jack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wrapsaround Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guardthrough a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from theceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting anddodging around the furnace -Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKSinto Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up,kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from theceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second,hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, fallsdown, gets up -Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit.Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.                    WILL (CONT'D)          You cheated.                    JACK              (smiles; what do you expect?)          Pirate.Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking thedoor.                       JACK (CONT'D)          Move away.                       WILL          No.                       JACK          Move!                    WILL          No. I can not just step aside and          let you escape.Jack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-offlasts for a long moment.                    JACK          You're lucky, boy -- this shot's          not meant for you.Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack-Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack'sskull. Jack crumples to the ground.The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill theroom. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.                    NORRINGTON          Excellent work, Mister Brown.          You've aided in the capture of a          dangerous fugitive.                    BROWN          Just doing my civic duty.Jack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.                    NORRINGTON          I believe you will always remember          this as the day Captain Jack          Sparrow almost escaped.Norrington's men haul Jack away.

I recognize this ship.          I saw it eight years ago, when we          made the crossing from England.                    BARBOSSA              (interested)          Did you, now?Elizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere.                    ELIZABETH          Fine. I suppose if this is          worthless, there's no reason to          keep it.She flips the medallion up, off her finger -                    BARBOSSA          NO!She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.

The other pirates          surreptitiously exchange glances          and nods.                    BARBOSSA          You've got sand, for a maid.                    ELIZABETH              (curtsies again)          Thank you, sir.                    BARBOSSA          And how does a maid come to own a          trinket such as that? A family          heirloom, perhaps?                    ELIZABETH          Of course.              (offended)          I didn't steal it, if that's what          you mean.                    BARBOSSA          No, no, nothing like that.              (comes to a decision)          Very well. You hand that over,          we'll put your town to our rudder          and ne'er return.                    ELIZABETH          Can I trust you?                    BARBOSSA          It's you who invoked the parlay!          Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand          it over, now... or these be the          last friendly words you'll hear!Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds outthe medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist likehope.                    ELIZABETH          Our bargain. . ?Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun.

Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved.The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away.                    ELIZABETH          Wait! You must return me to shore!          According to the rules of the          Order of the Brethren -Barbossa wheels on her.                     BARBOSSA          First. Your return to shore was          not part of our negotiations nor          our agreement, and so I 'must' do          nothing. Secondly: you must be a          pirate for the pirate's code to          apply. And you're not.

He also said if          that be the case, you'll be dining with          the crew, and you'll be naked.Angry, Elizabeth holds out her hand. Pintel's grin fades.

BARBOSSA          Maid or not, it fits you.                    ELIZABETH          Dare I ask the fate of its previous          owner?                    BARBOSSA          Now, none of that. Please dig in.The table is set. Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece ofmeat, eats it daintily.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          No need to stand on ceremony, and no          call to impress anyone. You must be          hungry.Elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins toeat like it. Barbossa watches her intently.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          Try the wine.Elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread,devours it.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          And the apples -- one of those next.She starts to bite into the apple -- stops. She is suddenlyaware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating.

BARBOSSA          Oh, there would be no sense in killing          you, Miss Turner.                    ELIZABETH          Then why aren't you eating?                    BARBOSSA          Would that I could.He produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          Do you not know what this is,          then?                    ELIZABETH          It's a pirate medallion.                    BARBOSSA          It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de          Muerta .Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despiteherself.                    BARBOSSA (CONT 'D)          Ah, so you don't know as much as you          pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a          great bloody swath through the New          World, a high priest gave. him all the          gold they had, with one condition: that          he spare the people's lives. Of course,          Cortes being Cortes, he didn't.              (nods)          He'd've made a great pirate, that one.Barbossa stands, moves to a shelf. Puts a key to a medium-sized polished wooden box -- the Captain's chest. Opens it.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          So the priest, with his dying breath,          called on the power of the blood of his          people, and put on the gold a curse. If          anyone took so much as a single piece,          as he was compelled by greed, by greed          he would be consumed.Inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and afew pages of a Mayan CODEX, pieces of tree bark inscribedwith Mayan glyphs. Barbossa removes them carefully, setsthem on the table. Pours over them.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          Within a day of leaving port for Spain,          the treasure ship carrying the gold ...          something went wrong. The ship run          aground, every man aboard dead, save          one. He survived long enough to hide          the gold ashore.              (beat)          Over time, the dark magic of the curse          seeped into the place, making it a          cursed island. An island of death. Isla          de Muerta.He looks up. Elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story-but feigns a dismissive attitude.                    ELIZABETH          That's all very interesting, but I          hardly believe in ghost stories          any more.Barbossa is angry. He stands, sweeps the food off thetable.                    BARBOSSA          You idiot girl! It's no make-          believe! My crew and I, we found          the gold, and we did more than          take one piece, we took it all.          Rich men we were and we spent it          and traded it and gave it away in          exchangefor drink and food and pleasant company. But we found out:the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashesin our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could easeour torment.(regains his composure)We are cursed men, Miss Turner,condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed. Goldcalls to UB, always, and we are driven, always, to findmore, and add it to the treasure.Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex. Crushes them in hisfist.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          There is but one way to remove the          curse. All of the scattered pieces          of the treasure must be restored          in full, and the blood repaid.                 (he throws the pages                  aside)             We've recovered every piece --             save for this.                 (holds up the medallion)             And as for the blood ... that's             what we have you for.                 (pleasant, finally                  getting to his point)             And that's why there's no sense in             killing you. Yet.Elizabeth stares at him, horrified. Using the toe of hisboot, Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it,extends it to Elizabeth.

He opens his shirt toget a better look at the knife, pulls it out with littleeffort. There is BLOOD on the blade, but none anywhereelse.                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)             I'm curious -- after killing me,             what is it you were planning to do             next?Elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door -EXT.

Most of the decent pirates in town          won't sail with you -- seem to          think you're a jinx.                    JACK          Now where, I wonder, would they          have gotten that idea?Gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip. Jack leansforward. Gibbs leans forward.                    JACK (CONT'D)          I'm going after the Black Pearl.Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. Hereaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets itback down. He leans forwards again. Jack has not moved.                       GIBBS          Say again?                    JACK          Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I          know where its going to be, and          I'm going to take it.                     GIBBS          Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've          heard the tales they tell about          the Pearl.                    JACK          Aye, and that's why I know where it's          going to be, and that's why I know what          Barbossa is up to. All I need is a          crew.                    GIBBS              (shakes his head)          A fool's errand.                       JACK          Not if the fool has something          Barbossa wants. Something he          needs.                    GIBBS          And you've got that, have you?ANGLE ON: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts hiseyes' -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailoraway from the table.                    JACK          Back there, guarding the door is          the son of old Bootstrap Bill          Turner.Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers atWill. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones.                    GIBBS          Well, lookee there. I'll allow you          may be onto something, Jack.              (considers, nods)          There's bound to be sailors on          this rock crazy as you. I'll find          some men.Gibbs downs the drink, SLAMS the tankard on the table.Will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger,kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone whomoves.                    GIBBS (CONT'D)          Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?                    JACK          That he is.EXT. TORTUGA - DOCK - LATER - DAYOn the docks, a disheveled, motley and weatherbeaten groupof about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up.                    GIBBS          Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em          good sea-faring men, faithful hands          before the mast, every one worth his          salt --              (sotto, making his point)          -- and crazy, to boot.Jack holds up a hand -- enough. He moves down the line,Gibbs at his side. Then he notices AnaMaria in line,dressed like a man, He raises an eyebrow.                    ANAMARIA          You owe me a boat.Jack nods, continues. One sailor is quite fat, anotherthin and sickly. Jack is not happy with his choices.He stops in front of COTTON, a short sailor with a large,colorful PARROT on his shoulder. Jack raises an eyebrow.                    GIBBS          Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor          devil had his tongue cut out --Cotton opens his mouth to show this -- Jack grimaces.                    GIBBS (CONT'D)          -- so he went and trained the parrot to          do the talking for him, nobody knows          how. Nobody knows the parrot's name,          neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's          parrot.'Jack decides to test this.                    JACK          Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage          and fortitude to follow orders and stay          true, in the face danger, and almost          certain death?Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it --                    COTTON'S PARROT          Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS!                    GIBBS          Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'Cotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goessilent. Jack shakes his head. Steps back.                    JACK          That goes for the rest of you!          Danger and near certain death.              (turns away)          For we are to sail for the Isla de          Muerta, to rescue the daughter of          Governor Swann. An equal share of the          reward shall be -Jack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crewmembers back away in fright; first one, then another, turnand run, followed by more.Soon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (withparrot) -- and AnaMaria.                    WILL          Shut up, before you lose them all!                    JACK          These are the only ones worth          having.              (glances at the sky)          And we're going to need them-EXT. H. M. S. INTERCEPTOR - DAYA FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder. The canvasof every sail is stretched taut. The ship rocks as it dropsinto the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side.On board, the new crew members scurry about their tasks,pulling lines and trimming sails. Excellent sailors, ittakes everything they have to keep the ship afloat.AnaMaria is at the helm. Gibbs staggers along the deck.                    GIBBS          That fool will have us lose the          canvas, and the masts besides!On Jack, a ROARING wind blowing back his hair, eyes intenton their course. Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him.                    GIBBS (CONT'D)          Werd best drop canvas, sirl                    JACK          She can hold a bit longer.The wind picks up, howling. Jack smiles.                    GIBBS              (shouts)          What's in your head to put you in such          a fine mood?                    JACK              (shouts)          We're catching up!Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself. Gibbs staresat him like he's a crazy man.'INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAYThe sound of RAIN pounds down on the deck above - - thensuddenly stops. Elizabeth moves to the stern windows, looksout at the rolling sea below -- no escape there.She hears the sound of a VQICE calling, gazes up, wondering-EXT. BLACK PEARL - CROW' S NEST - DAYHigh on the main mast, Twigg cups his hands to his face, callsdown:                    TWIGG          Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta,          off the port bow!ON DECK, Barbossa moves to the rail. The storm clouds arebreaking up. On the horizon is a dark, ominous shape: ISLA DEMUERTA. Mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight intothe water. It is surrounded by a slate grey sea.Barbossa grasps the rail with both hands, his expression amixture of loathing and fear. Jacoby approaches, hesitant.                    JACOBY          Orders, Captain?                    BARBOSSA          Bring her in, not too close. I won't          brave the reef, not until high tide. We          lay anchor before dark.Jacoby nods, backs away. Barbossa continues to stare -                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          ... that is, if it first doesn't          sink back down to hell from where          it came.EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAYThe Interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sailsset wing-to-wing.EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAYCLOSE ON: Jack's compass, cradled in both hands. Jack leansover and studies it -- almost like he's praying.ON THE COMPASS -- the face shows old-fashioned rose petalstyle direction markers below a quivering indicator thatsettles on -- southeast.                    JACK          Bear three points starboard.AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. The ship leansinto the new direction. Jack looks down -ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins, reverses,settles on -- northeast.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Six points port!AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheelback, and the ship responds.Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jackand AnaMaria, clearly not happy. Gibbs hobbles up.                    GIBBS          Left handed-ropes are coiled against          the sun, or it's bad luck!              (twirls a finger)          Anty-clockwise.Gibbs takes over the task. The ship shifts course again.Will has had enough.                    WILL          How do we expect to find an island no          one can find -- with a compass that          doesn't work?                    GIBBS          Now, lad, just because it don't point          north don't mean it don't work.              (voice low)          That compass gives bearings to the Isla          de Muerta, wherever it may lie.                    WILL          Really?              (moves closer)          So ... what's the story on the          pistol?Gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener.                    GIBBS          I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow          has an honest streak in him, and          that's where the whole problem          starts. This was when he was          Captain of the Black Pearl -                    WILL          What? He never told me that.                    GIBBS          Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things          more close to the vest. See, Jack was a          cartographer, back in Old England.          Somehow I he came by the money to          commission the Pearl. Hired himself a          crew, promised each man an equal share.              (lowers his voice)          So, they're forty days out, and the          First Mate says, everything's an equal          share, that should mean the location of          the island, too. So Jack gave up the          bearings.              (shakes his head)          That night, there was mutiny.Gibbs voice is a whisper, now, so Will has to lean closer.                    GIBBS (CONT'D)          Jack gave hisself up for the sake of          his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on          an island, left there to die.                    WILL          How did he get off the island?                    JACK              (loud)          I didn't!Will and Gibbs jump. Jack is right there beside them.                    JACK (CONT'D)          My body's still there, rotting          away, and I am but a ghost!Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. Jacklaughs.                    GIBBS          How did you get off the island?                    JACK          Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant          tale, best left untold.He starts off.                    WILL          Wait -- what about the pistol?                    JACK          The pistol. When a pirate is marooned,          Will, he's given a pistol with a single          shot. No good for hunting, or          surviving, really. But after three          weeks of starvation and thirst -- the          option of that pistol begins to look          good.Jack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it.                    JACK (CONT'D)          But I survived. And I still have          that single shot. It's meant for          one man. My mutinous first mate -                    WILL          Barbossa.Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away.EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENINGOn Barbossa, face upturned. No expression in his eyes.Around him a group of pirates, Elizabeth among them, standas still as stones, in front of a dark cave opening. Theirfaces look upward, their total lack of movementdisconcerting.Above the cave, on a hillock, the pirate Koehler gazes outtoward the horizon. Slowly he TRANSFORMS, head-to-toe, frompirate to SKELETON-The MOON has climbed free of the storm clouds, risinglarge. and full on the horizon. The skeleton turns -                    KOEHLER          Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.                      BARBOSSA          Hah!              (to the pirates)          Be mindful of pits and crevasses.          Stay together.He takes a torch. Moves into the cave. The pirates follow.INT. ISLA DE MUERTE -     CAVES    - NIGHTThe group keeps together under the firelight. The pathleads between boulders on a slope downhill. From the echoesand shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge.Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns offto the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins.Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness.Twigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away fromthe group. Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm.                    BARBOSSA          Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd          die and miss Judgement Day -- for not          even the Lord himself'll come look for          you here.Barbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twistingand turning, but always down -EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - NIGHTCotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something. Helifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along theback.                    COTTON'S PARROT          Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND          ho!Indeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in thedistance on the port side. Will stands, excited, jumps ontothe rigging for a better look.But AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and theparrot.                    ANAMARIA          How does he do that?                    JACK          They'll be anchored on the lee side.          Haul your wind, and keep to the weather          of the island -INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVES - NIGHTFlickering torchlight. Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern--- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla deMuerta: overflowing ,chests of coins, gold and silveringots, jewelry, objects d' art, jade and ivory, brightlycolored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors andswords -anything and everything of value that might becarried by ship, is here.The pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze inwonder.                    ELIZABETH          The curse drove you to gather          this?                    BARBOSSA (O.S.)          Aye. And not a bit of it any use          to us, only hoarded. But it will          drive us no longer.Elizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrustedmirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates.EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - LAGOON - NIGHTThe Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance. Closer,Jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a smalllongboat, toward the rocky shore.The RUSH of a waterfall grows louder. Will looks: ahead ofthem is a black CAVE MOUTH, right at water level.                    WILL          What's that?                     JACK          Depends.                     WILL          On what?                    JACK          On whether the stories are    all          true. If they are, that's    a          waterfall that spills over    at high          tide, with a short drop to    an          underground lagoon. If not    -By now, the moving water tugs on the longboat, and they aresucked in --                    JACK (CONT'D)          -- well, too late.The boat rushes forward, plunges into the darkness -INT. CAVES - UNDERWATER LAGOON - NIGHT-- the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a shortwaterfall ... but then lands safely in a gorgeousunderwater lagoon, floats lazily toward a sandy shore.

CAVES - BED CAVERN - NIGHTThe pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber ofmostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed -INT. CAVES - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT-- and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, alsocrammed with treasure, including several mountains of goldcoins that reach the ceiling. Treasure everywhere -Except for one spot in the center. A hole in the ceilinglets in a column of moonlight, which illumines:A stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved Aztecglyphs, filled with gold coins identical to Will'smedallion. A sharp stone knife lies on top.In front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton -- andthis one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again,judging by the sword in its back. A crab scurries away fromit as the group approaches.                    BARBOSSA          Here we stand before the cursed          treasure of Cortez himself. Won by          blood, it demands blood in return.All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth. Pintle takes the stoneknife from the chest, approaches her. Elizabeth shrinksback, but is held by two other pirates.Pintel grins. Grabs her by the wrist. She turns her headaway, shuts her eyes.Pintle raises the knife ...... and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharptip of the knife to just prick! Elizabeth's finger.One tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto themedallion.Elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised.                    PINTEL             What did you expect? We're all             gentlemen here, right and proper.The pirates laugh. Barbossa takes the medallion, grins atElizabeth.                       BARBOSSA             You know the first thing I'm going             to do after the curse is lifted?

Jacoby reactsin shock, grabs his chest ... but doesn't die.                       KOEHLER             You're not dead.

What was          his name?!

Barbossa gathers himself,getting his rage under steely control.                    BARBOSSA          Where's his child? The child that          sailed from England eight years          ago, the child who is the real          owner of that medallion, the child          in whose veins flows the blood of          William Turner?! Where?Barbossa SLAPS her hard across the face, sending hersprawling.                    JACOBY              (to Pintel)          You brought us the wrong person!

TWIGG              (to Barbossa)          You brought us here for nothing?Barbossa whirls on him --                    BARBOSSA          If you had sailed with Morgan for          ten years like I have, you'd know          not to question me!Elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a momentunnoticed. Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right aboveher.Startled, Elizabeth looks up ---- Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching downwith his scabbard for her to grab onto.Elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodiedmedallion from the pile. Reaches back, grabs the scabbard.Will pulls her up -                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          If any coward here dare challenge          me, let him speak! Any more talk,          I'll chain ye to a cannon and send          ye to the watery depths!A sound catches his attention -- coins falling.

JACK          No. This won't work.              (a quick decision)          I'll stay behind, and fight them.          You go on.Will and Elizabeth stare at him.                    WILL          No.                    JACK          I'll lead them away.The sounds are closer.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Go to the opposite end of the          island, and signal the ship. I'll          keep 'em busy.                    WILL          Are you sure? Jack -- this is not          something you have to do.                    JACK          I'm sure. When you've led the kind          of life I have, there are debts          that must be paid. Maybe I can          balance the scales a little.Will nods, hesitates... gives Jack his sword - - now Jackhas two, ..one for each hand.

ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHTJack stands before Barbossa, surrounded by pirates. Jackhas a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesn't likeit.                    BARBOSSA          I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack          Sparrow, without so much as a          word, if you don't lose that grin          from your face.Jack's smile remains. Barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass -                    JACK          The woman's blood didn't work, did          it?Barbossa hesitates.                    JACK (CONT'D)          I know who's blood you need, to          end the curse.                    BARBOSSA          Say the name, or I slit your          throat.                    JACK          No you won't.Barbossa nods. Pintel steps forward, puts a blade to Jack'sthroat. Jack's smile widens.                      PINTEL          Now?                      BARBOSSA (NODS)          Now.              (Pintel grins)          No, don't kill him.Surprised, Pintel lowers his cutlass. Jack's expressionhasn't changed.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          Allow me the humor of listening to          your terms.                    JACK          Simple. I have something you want more          than anything. The way to free you from          the curse of the treasure. You have          something I want -- more than anything.                     BARBOSSA          The Pearl?              (laughs)          Oh, that's fine. And just how do          you expect this to work?                    JACK          You give me the Pearl. Then I tell          you who you need.Barbossa stares at him, incredulous.                    BARBOSSA          That's your offer? You, sailing          away nice and pretty with the          Black Pearl, and all I have is a          name?                    JACK          That's right.                    BARBOSSA          I'm supposed to ... trust you?The pirates laugh.                    JACK          I'm a man of my word.The pirates laugh louder.                    JACK (CONT' D)          You see, I've got this honest streak in me          -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and          there's the fact that you have no choice.                    BARBOSSA          I'll torture it out of you.                    JACK          You left me on a desert island --          what worse can you do?Jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now. Barbossasees his options dwindling, begins to pace.                    BARBOSSA          Blast you! I'll throw you in          prison.                    JACK          Wait as long as you like.                    BARBOSSA          You're setting me up for a double          cross, you with the ship, and me with          nothing more than your word!                    JACK          Let's say I tell you the wrong          person. What would you do?                    BARBOSSA          Track you down and -He sees where Jack is headed.                    JACK          And if I tell you the truth, you become          mortal, and you won't come near me          because you know I'd kill you.Barbossa hesitates. The pirates are amazed at how the tidehas turned; Barbossa has gone past considering the idea,and might even do it.                    BARBOSSA          Jack, I don't trust you, and          that's a fact. Never trust a          smiling man, you can lay to that.                    JACK          See, that's where we're different.          I trust you ... to do what it          takes to get what you want.                    BARBOSSA          You're playing this as close to          the edge as any man, I'll give you          that.              (decides, smiles)             We might just have to sign             articles, you and I. Jack, you're             a pirate at heart, that's certain.Jack nods.                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)             Pintel ... set sail. If this fool plan             is to work, we'll need the medallion,             and that means catching the ship which             brought 'em here.Jack is caught completely off guard. For the first time,his smile fades.                       JACK             What -- you don't have the medallion?                       BARBOSSA             That fool woman took it. You be             careful around her, Jack -- she's             pretty enough, she'll steal your             heart -- but pure evil inside.                       JACK             I'll watch my back.                       BARBOSSA             Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters,             nice and fine ... in the brig.                 (to Jack, a smile)             Meaning no disrespect, of course.Jack nods, and is taken away. Barbossa stares after him,not hiding his mistrust.EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAYAt full sail, headed out to sea.

A man don't have to             be superstitious to know that's             trouble.Elizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale:                    ELIZABETH          ... you were in danger ... so I took          the medallion. And I've kept it ever          since. They thought I was you, that          they needed my blood. And it didn't          work.She hands him the medallion.                    WILL          Why would my father send this to me?                    ELIZABETH          To keep it away from them? No pirate          would sail to London, for fear of          Execution Dock.                    WILL          If I had known-                    ELIZABETH              (anticipating him)          -- then we never would have met.Will nods. They hold each other's gaze a moment. Will turnsaway first, leans on the rail. Looks out to sea, back thedirection they came.                    WILL          I can't believe he would make such          a sacrifice for us.

BARBOSSA          Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board,          you played me right clever, make          pretending and all. I hope your stay          this time is more pleasant. Boys, show          her some hospitality!He shoves her into a group of pirates; they yell theirapproval. She is pushed from one to another.This goads Will to action.

That reef is less than a          league distant. It's a square deal all          around, and you can't hope for better.                    JACK          Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.Barbossa smiles, shows a pistol. Points it at Jack.                    BARBOSSA          You'd best take a swim, Jack.

PINTEL          That's proper, sir, according to the          code.                    BARBOSSA          By the Powers, you're right!              ( turns around)          Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got          it? Bring it forward!                    JACK          A gentleman might give us two pistols,          seeing as there are two of us, this          time.A pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa.                    BARBOSSA          Tell you what. I'll   give you one          pistol, and let you   be the gentleman,          an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death          yourself!              (grins)          That is, presuming   you're not both drownded.The pirates laugh. Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- butover his head, and down into the water with a splash.                    BARBOSSA (CONTID)          So how did you get off that island,          anyway?                    JACK          You can go to your grave not knowing.                    BARBOSSA          That's fair.Jack glares at Barbossa. Then he's prodded with a cutlass,takes a step out. Reaches the end of the plank -- stepsoff.Jack plunges down into the water. Appears on the surface,floundering, struggles to stay afloat. Will and Elizabethexchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do.                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)          The lady's next. But first, I'll be          wanting that dress back, if you please.Elizabeth hesitates ... then strips it off, leaving her ina silk slip. She throws it at him.                    ELIZABETH          Here -- it will go well with your          black heart !Barbossa indicates the plank.                    ELIZABETH (CONT' D)          I will not walk into the ocean.          You'll have to throw me in!Barbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods.                    BARBOSSA          Have at her, lads!The pirates rush to comply. Lift her up, toss her over therail -- with a scream she falls --EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - UNDERWATER - DAYWe follow Elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she PLUNGESdownthrough the water. Blue and clear, with streaks of sunlightcutting down; bright coral and tropical fish, and a lovelyyoung woman in a silk dress. .. if it weren't for themortal danger, the scene could be described as gorgeous.Elizabeth spots Jack, below her now, sinking, struggling.She swims down ... unties his bonds.Elizabeth starts for the surface. Inexplicably, Jack swimsthe other way, further down into the depths.EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAYElizabeth breaks the surface, looks around. And then,finally Jack appears, sucking in air. He shows what he wentafter: his pistol. He tucks it into his shirt.                    ELIZABETH          You went back for that? We need to          head for the reef!She starts swimming. Jack hesitates. The Black Pearl isalready underway; he stares at it.                    JACK          That's the second time I've had to          watch that man sail away with my ship.He turns away, and swims after Elizabeth.EXT. ISLET - BEACH - DAYCLOSE ON: The surf line. Elizabeth's feet leave prints inthe sand ... and then meet up with matching footprints shemade earlier, going in the same direction. She has walkedall the way around the island.                    JACK (O.S.)          Not all that big, is it?Jack lays on the beach. He has dismantled his pistol; theparts, ball and powder dry on his scarf.                     ELIZABETH          Has it changed since the last time you          were here?                    JACK          The trees are taller.Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are.He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol.                    ELIZABETH          I hope you have no intention of using          that.Jack has finished putting his pistol back together. Heshoves it in his belt, walks off.                    JACK          Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.Elizabeth can't believe it.                    ELIZABETH          Captain Sparrow! We have to get          off this island -- immediately!                    JACK          Don't be thinking I'm not already          working on it.He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees. Digs forsomething beneath the sand. He finds it: a large iron ring.                    ELIZABETH          What is that? Is there a boat          under there?Jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit.Inside are barrels and bottles of rum ... all covered withdust and cobwebs, long abandoned. Jack's face falls.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          What? What's wrong? How will this          help us get off the island?                    JACK          It won't. It won't, and so we          won't.He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum,.takes a swig.                    ELIZABETH          But ... you did it before! Last          time -                    JACK          Last time, I was here a grand          total of three days. Last time,          the rumrunners who used this          island as a cache came by, and I          bartered passage off.                    JACK (CONT'D)          But from the looks of this,          they've long been'out of business,          and so that won't be happening          again.              (takes another swig)          We probably have your friend          Norrington to thank for that.                    ELIZABETH          So that's it? That's the secret          grand adventure of the infamous          Jack Sparrow? You spent three days          on the beach drinking rum?                    JACK          Welcome to the Caribbean, love.He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach.                    JACK (CONT'D)          You should look at our contretemps          this way: we've got shade trees,          thank the Lord. We've got some          food on the trees, thank the Lord          again. And we've got rum, praise          the Lord. We can stay alive a          month, maybe more. Keep a weather          eye open for passing ships, and          our chances are fair.                    ELIZABETH          A month? Will doesn't have a          month! We've got to do something          to help him!                    JACK          You're right.              (hoists the bottle)          Here's luck to you, Will Turner.He drinks -- and defiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze.But then turns away, sits down.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Don't be thinking I'm happy about          this, Elizabeth. But I see no use          in wailing and gnashing my teeth          over that which I can do nothing          about.                    ELIZABETH          Not when you can drink instead, at          least.Jack tosses her a bottle.                    JACK          Try it. It goes down rough, but it          goes down - - and the second swig          goes down easier.Elizabeth considers. Comes to a decision. She unseals thebottle, takes a swig. They sit in silence for a bit.                    ELIZABETH          And you will call me Miss Swann.Jack toasts her: you got it. Elizabeth studies herbottle... gives Jack a sidelong glance. Back to her bottle...                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)              (under her breath)          Drink up me hearties, yo ho...                    JACK          What? What was that?              (Elizabeth smiles)          Something funny, Miss Swann? share.          Please,                    ELIZABETH          Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ...          I'm reminded of a song I learned          as a child. A song about pirates.                    JACK          I know a lot of songs about pirates,          but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear          it.                    ELIZABETH          Oh, no ... it's silly.   Back in          England we didn't know   a thing          about pirates, really.   They seemed          so romantic and daring   -Jack likes the way that sounds.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)              (looks at him)          That was before I met one, of          course.                    JACK          Now I must hear this song. An          authentic pirate song. Have at it.                    ELIZABETH          Well, perhaps ... with a bit more          to drink, I might ...                    JACK          More to drink!He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. She dropsher half-finished bottle to catch it. Opens it, takes asip.                    JACK (CONT'D)          Well?Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self-consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on.                    ELIZABETH          We pillage, we plunder, we rifle,          we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo          ho.She gestures for him to drink. He does.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          We kidnap and ravage and we don't          give a hoot, Drink up me hearties,          yo ho -EXT. ISLET - BEACH - LATER - NIGHTThe middle of the night. A fire BLAZES. Jack and Elizabethare roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the wayup to the stars --                    JACK/ELIZABETH          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for          me!Yo ho, yo ho, it's a pirates life for me!                    JACK          I LOVE this song!              (sings)          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for          me! We're beggars and blighters,          ne'er do well cads, Drink up me          hearties, yo ho!              (gives it a touch of               Irish ballad)          Aye but we're loved by our mums and our          dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks. He drainsthe bottle, then tosses it away.                    JACK   (CONT'D)          When I get the   Black Pearl back, I'm          going to teach   it to the whole crew,          and we'll sing   it all the time!                    ELIZABETH          You'll be positively the most fearsome          pirates to sail the Spanish Main.Elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle. Jack doesn'thave a bottle to salute back. She hands him hers. Hedrinks, then settles shakily to the ground. Elizabeth sitsbeside him.                    JACK          Not just the Spanish Main. The whole          ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we          want to go, we go. That's what a ship          is, you know. Not just a keel and a          hull and a deck and sails. That's what          a ship need_ ... but what a ship is --          what the Black Pearl really-is ... is          freedom.Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder.                    ELIZABETH          Jack, it must be so terrible for you,          to be trapped here on this island, all          over again.                    JACK          Ah, well... the company is better          than last time. And the scenery          has definitely improved.                      ELIZABETH              (coy)          Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had          enough rum to allow that kind of talk.                    JACK          We've got a few bottles left ...          and we've yet to tap the kegs.Elizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile.She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up.                    ELIZABETH          To freedom.                    JACK          To the Black Pearl.They tap the bottles together. Elizabeth feigns a drink ashe chugs. He taps his bottle against her again. She laughs,feigns another drink -EXT. ISLET - BEACH - MORNINGCLOSE ON -- JACK'S FACE, dead asleep, lying in thesunlight. His nose twitches. A bit of SMOKE drifts by. Hisnose twitches again. His eyes open.Jack GROANS and sits up. He rubs his head, looks over --- all of the foliage in the middle of the island is ONFIRE. Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky.Jack leaps to his feet. He sees Elizabeth, as she pours outthe last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of apalm tree. It goes up in FLAMES. She rolls the barrelforward -- it starts to BURN merrily.Jack can't believe his eyes.                    JACK          What are you doing? You've burned          our food, the shade -- the rum!                    ELIZABETH          Yes, the rum is gone.She wipes her hands together. One of the rum barrels in thefire EXPLODES.                    JACK          Why?                    ELIZABETH          One, because it is a vile drink that          turns even the most respectable men          into scoundrels. Two -She points to the sky.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          That signal is over a thousand feet          high, which means it can be seen for          two hundred leagues in every direction.          The entire Royal Navy is out to sea          looking for me -- do you think there is          even a chance they could mass it?                    JACK          You -- you burned up the island, for a          one-time chance at being spotted?                     ELIZABETH          Exactly.Elizabeth turns toward the sea.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          Just you wait, Captain. In an hour,          maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open'          and you'll be seeing white sails on          that horizon!She sits down, determined. Shields her eyes, scans thewater, waiting, searching. Jack is speechless. He throws uphis hands, stalks up the sand dune, just to get away fromher.EXT. ISLET - LEEWARD SHORE - DAYAt the crest of the dune, Jack stops -- and stares,incredulous. We come around to see what he is looking at -Past Jack, anchored the other side of the island, whitesails glorious against the turquoise waters, is the H.M.S.Dauntless. A longboat is already being rowed toward them.Jack shakes his head.                     JACK          They'll be no living with her          after this.EXT. H.M.S.

JACK              (she's right)          We had time to get to know each other.                    NORRINGTON          We are bound for Port Royal, not          Isla de Muerta.

That is what we shall          do. Mr. Turner's fate is          regrettable. But so was his          decision to engage in piracy.                    ELIZABETH          Commodore, please!                    JACK          Norrington, think about it ... the          Black Pearl, its captain and          crew... the last pirate threat in          the Caribbean. How can you pass          that up?                    NORRINGTON          By remembering that I serve          others, not only myself.

He thought we deserved to be cursed,          for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we          did. That's why he sent off a piece of          the treasure -- to you, as it were: so          it would never be recovered, and so          cursed we_ remain.

There          you'll be, with two lovely ships on          your hands, and what to do? Of course          you'll decide you deserve the bigger          one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless          a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it,          you can rule the seas.

JACK (CONT'D)          I sail for you as part of your fleet, I          give you fifteen percent of my plunder,          and you get to introduce yourself at          tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore          Barbossa.'

JACK (CONT'D)          Now, you can take care of the          Dauntless, right?                    BARBOSSA          Men! Are you up for it?The pirates yell to the affirmative.

Bloodblossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreadsquickly.Barbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain forthe first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to theground, dead.Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol...tosses it away.EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHTMurtogg FIRES a pistol at a pirate. The pirate is hit,screams in pain, and crumples to the ground. Mullroy runsthrough another with his sword.The pirates react to the sight, and quickly realize theirperil. They set their weapons down in surrender.EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHTThe Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless, and Jack'screw swarm across, overwhelming the pirates.The sailors on the beach see it, and CHEER.INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHTWill wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near thechest.                    WILL          Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever          heard of.              (smiles)          You're a man who can be trusted, who          can be counted on, and who can It          betray his friends. What kind of pirate          is that?                     JACK              (admits it)          The worst.              (beat)          On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who          can't pass up a chance for revenge          against the black-hearted bastard who          stole my ship and left me to die in the          middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and          who knows how to get what he wants. Now          that's a great pirate.Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest... and then hesitates.Will looks at him...Jack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside theother bloody coin.Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT.Elizabeth stares at it.                    WILL          Let's get out of here.EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT - LATERJack, Will, and Norrington gather together on the beach.Elizabeth calls out:                    ELIZABETH          You're all right!The three men turn as one. An awkward moment -- which ofthem does she mean?Elizabeth races across the sand, toward them -- andstraight to Will. She throws her arms around his neck in ahug.                    WILL          Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers?          And how did you get off the island?Elizabeth can't believe that's what he noticed. Indignant,she steps away from him.                    ELIZABETH          Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for          how we got off the island -- ah, that's          a grand adventure, but now is not the          time to talk about it.She reaches a hand behind his neck, decisively kisses him.                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)          There. And don't you dare tell me          that wasn't a proper kiss!                    WILL          Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter-          that we are of a different class -                    ELIZABETH          It doesn't!                    WILL          -- but that was not a proper kiss.Pure consternation on Elizabeth's face -                    WILL (CONT'D)          This is a proper kiss.Will sweeps her in his arms, leans her back, and kisses herlong and well -Jack puts a hand on Norrington's shoulder.                    JACK          Tough luck. I was rooting for you.EXT. PORT ROYAL - FORT CHARLES - DAYClose on: Will's face, stoic, staring forward. He standsstraight and unmoving. Around him are members of the RoyalNavy, standing before for a group of witnesses from town.It is the courtyard on the top of Fort Charles. A trial isunderway -- with Will as the defendant.                      NORRINGTON          ...and though I do say so with          regret, the law is clear. The          penalty for piracy is death by          hanging.In the crowd, Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father,Swann. She lets go as Swann stands.                    SWANN          By your leave, I wish to speak on          behalf of the boy.              (a glance at Elizabeth)          It is clear that these deeds were          performed out of a sincere desire   to do          good, at great personal risk. It   seems          to me, that in the rare occasion   where          the right course is committing an   act          of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the          right course!              (cheers of approval)          So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend          to grant a pardon to --                    GILLETTE          Sir!All eyes turn. Gillette stands at the top of a stairway.                    GILLETTE (CONT'D)          Jack and his crew have escaped!              (gasps from the crowd)          There was no damage to the cell ...          they must have been set free.Will and Elizabeth exchange looks. You? Not me, you? No,not me either! Swann notices something the parapet, points-                    SWANN          The Black Pearl!People rush to the parapet. Sure enough, below in the bayare the distinctive black sails of the Pearl. The ship cutsthrough the waters very close to the point --- where the gallows of the pirates are. Suddenly Jackappears, on the point; he swings off the one emptygallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as itpasses.                    GILLETTE          Sir! Shall I break out the          cannons?                    NORRINGTON          I don't think that will be necessary.Norrington raises his hand ... twirls a key on his finger.                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)          A day's head start. That's all he gets.Will, Elizabeth and Swann look out toward ocean-EXT. BLACK PEARL - STERN DECK - DAYJack monkeys down the rigging. AnaMaria is at the wheel.                    ANAMARIA          Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl          is yours!Jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail, then takes thewheel. It feels good -- right -- in his hands. He enjoysit, and then shifts to 'Captain' mode.                    JACK          AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!                    ANAMARIA          Aye, aye, sir!                    JACK          Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -          you and Cotton. I want every inch of          the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!Gibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute.Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and allis right with the world. He begins to unconsciously hum:"Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me ..."He realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takesover as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters ... andwe FADE UP large words in script:                    THE END          FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL
