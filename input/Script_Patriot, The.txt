THE PATRIOT by Robert Rodat October 9, 1998FADE IN:CREDITS OVER:EXT. SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAYWoodlands. Beautiful. Untamed. Soaring old-growth elmsarch over riverside maples along the shores of the gentlycurving, deep-water Santee River.SUPERIMPOSITION: SOUTH CAROLINA April, 1776Upstream, the swamps. Beautiful. Hundreds of BIRDS SING.Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through thehanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying fernscovering the high ground.The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads,each with a stark white flower rising from it.SUPERIMPOSITION: THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORYEXT. POND BLUFF - DAYA farm built between the banks of the river and the deepgreen of the swamps. Good, fertile land, hacked out ofthe wilderness.The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops,alfalfa and tobacco. Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 andSAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swingingscythes through the barley.The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed andwell-maintained. There's a barn, a workshop and a forge.It is a home of substance rather than wealth. On thefront porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while herbrother, WILLIAM, 6, watches.GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woodswith a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over hisshoulder. At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying amusket.INT. WORKSHOP - DAYA perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged withevery conceivable tool of the period. A foot-poweredlathe. A drop-forge. A lifting saw. Racks of tools,planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging intheir places. All very well-worn.FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning apiece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with arazor-sharp chisel. He's in his late-forties, strong andweathered. His hands, though big and callused, handle thechisel with a surgeon's precision. Self-educated andself-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built hisfarm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth.A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel onwhich Marion is working, sits on the work table. Thechair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web ofperfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue.Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-facewisp of a child, watches her father.Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefullyfits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it intoplace. Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork.He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale,countering with a three-pound weight. The chair floats.Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks. Susannods, so far, so good. Marion puts the chair on the floorand walks slowly around it, checking every angle.Then, the acid test. He takes a deep breath and lowershimself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time.Not a creak. He smiles and sits back with a sigh.CRACK! THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPINGHIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood. MARION Damnation!He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across theroom but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look.He calms himself. MARION Sorry.Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains ofthe chair in the fireplace. As she climbs back up to herperch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts afresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all overagain.END CREDITS.EXT. WORKSHOP - DUSKMarion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side. Nathanand Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in thefield. NATHAN Father, I saw a post rider at the house. MARION Thank you. Did you finish the upper field? SAMUEL We got it all cut and we bundled half of it. MARION Those swimming breaks cut into the day, don't they?Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from hiscontrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass offthe blame. Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn. GABRIEL Father, a post rider came from Charleston. You have a letter inside. MARION Thank you. How's the spotted one's milk? THOMAS Better. She's near ready to calve.Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel andThomas to the house. She does so and Marion walks onalone toward:EXT. HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - SUNSETThe loveliest spot on the farm. A beautiful view of thehouse, barns, river, fields and hills beyond. Agravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree. Itreads: ELIZABETH PUTNAM MARION 1738-1773Above her name is a carving of the night sky, at thecenter of which is the NORTH STAR, steady and guiding.Marion approaches. He gives himself a moment to look atthe grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to thegravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-factthan sorrowful. MARION ... and they bundled half... almost no trace of the boys you knew...A soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground.Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply. MARION ... no, she still hasn't spoken... Margaret was her age when you... I remember the time at the river when we couldn't find Catherine... you couldn't stop crying... and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time...Marion pauses, remembering. The CRASH OF A PLATEBREAKING, followed by the SOUND OF AN ARGUMENT rises fromthe house below. Marion shakes his head with anexasperated sigh. MARION Your children.He heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing fromthe lights of candles and oil lamps.INT. MARION'S HOUSE - EVENINGPre-dinner chaos. Everyone talking at once. Marion'sseven children and his two family servants, ABIGAIL andAARON, a middle-aged black couple, prepare dinner. Susansilently watches from the stairs. Marion walks in. MARION I smell turnips... WILLIAM Father, Samuel broke the blue plate... SAMUEL I did not... MARGARET Dinner...Marion hands the apples to Abigail and steps over to openhis mail and dispatches. GABRIEL News of Boston, father? NATHAN I hate turnips... SAMUEL William knocked it right out of my hands... GABRIEL Father...? MARION Samuel, William, both of you clean it up...Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens aletter. MARION The Assembly has been reconvened, I've been called to...Marion's children go wild. MARGARET Charleston! NATHAN We're going to Charleston! SAMUEL When, father, when? MARION We'll leave tomorrow...The children ERUPT INTO CHEERS and THUNDER into the diningroom. THE CHILDREN Charleston! We're going to Charleston!Marion and Gabriel exchange a stone-faced look. ThenMarion puts on a smile and inhales deeply. MARION I love turnips...Marion follows his children into the dining room.EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHTQuiet.

MARGARET ... now count five finger lengths up from the front two stars of the Big Dipper, and that's the North Star, that's her.Susan gazes up at the North Star. The girls notice Marionand climb into bed. He puts a chair against Susan's bedand kisses her. He pulls a blanket up around Margaret,who whispers: MARGARET It helps her to know Mother's there.Marion nods with a thin smile, kisses Margaret and walksout.INT. MARION'S STUDY - NIGHTSquadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle asThomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men. Gabrielreads the new pamphlets and broadsides. Marion walks inand pours a drink. Gabriel hands several of the pamphletsto his father. GABRIEL The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved... MARION The middle colonies? GABRIEL Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent. He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats. MARION Anything about the convention in Philadelphia? GABRIEL Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extractinga delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box. Hebegins reading. GABRIEL Scott Higgins joined the militia.Marion hears but doesn't respond. Thomas looks up fromhis lead soldiers. GABRIEL He's seventeen. A year younger than I.Gabriel and Thomas wait for a reaction. There is none.Gabriel goes back to reading and Thomas resumes playingwith his toy soldiers. Marion's eyes drift from the pageto Gabriel.EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAYThe Marion family, in two tightly-packed carriages, driveson a beautiful road, cut through the swamps.

CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CHARLESTON - DAYGrand. Four stories. Marion and his children pull up.CHARLOTTE MOTTE hurries out. She's in her mid-thirties,beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden asbest she can.The children leap from the carriages and swarm around her,embracing her, smothering her with kisses. THE CHILDREN Aunt Charlotte! Aunt Charlotte! CHARLOTTE Welcome! Welcome! Margaret, William, look at you...! (to Marion) They're huge. What have you been feeding them? MARION They're from good stock on their mother's side. CHARLOTTE Thank you.Charlotte hustles the children toward the door. CHARLOTTE Come, come, inside, wait until you see what I have... THE CHILDREN (simultaneous) Presents! For me? What do you have? CHARLOTTE Inside, inside...Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows herinto the house.INT.

Marion andCharlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.EXT. CHARLESTON SQUARE - NIGHTDown the block from the Motte house. A yelling crowd ofSons of Liberty is massed around a Liberty Tree from whichhang dozens of glowing lanterns. Most of the men in thecrowd are drunk.

Scores of on-lookers, including respectablepeople, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards,watch the proceedings.Several Sons of Liberty string up effigies of King GeorgeIII and Governor Wilmington. They light the effigies onfire. As they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers.EXT. CHARLOTTE'S BALCONY - NIGHTMarion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balconywatching the mob. Marion steps out onto the balcony. MARION Inside, all of you...The children turn to Marion with stricken expressions.Marion relents. MARION Very well.The children turn back to the mob. Marion joins them. THOMAS Look! There's Gabriel!They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd. Hesees them and waves, then enters the house.A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony andsees:IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull downone of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, thenstart hacking at it's groin with a sword.Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps atthe children. CHARLOTTE Children, inside! All of you! Right now.The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte'sresolute expression makes them think better of it. Theyfile into the house. Charlotte shoots a glare at Marionand shoos the children inside. Gabriel steps out andjoins them. MARION What news? GABRIEL The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army. MARION Is that why the Assembly was convened? GABRIEL Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money. MARION And the Governor? GABRIEL He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body. MARION Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence. CHARLOTTE And send us to war alongside Massachusetts. MARION Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought. GABRIEL Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist.Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinksof Lee's expectations. Marion turns back to watch themob.EXT. ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAYThe capital building of South Carolina. A large crowd oflower-class men and women is massed in front of theAssembly Hall. As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into thebuilding, the CROWD YELLS words of encouragement to someand berates others.In the square in front of the Assembly Hall a squadron ofblue-uniformed AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS drills. Arecruiting table is being set up by a Continental Captainand several military clerks.Marion and Gabriel walk across the square toward theAssembly Hall. As they push their way through the crowd,Gabriel eyes the Continentals.INT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAYTwo dozen ANGRY, YELLING, MEN OF PROPERTY. Among them areROBINSON, HAMILL and JOHNSON, who are Patriots. Opposedto them are SIMMS, WITHINGTON and BALDRIDGE who areLoyalists (loyal the the King). As Marion makes his wayto his seat, the SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY POUNDS HIS GAVEL. SPEAKER ORDER! ORDER!Slowly, the room quiets down. SPEAKER Our first order of business... SIMMS And out last if we vote a levy...The ROOM ERUPTS. SPEAKER ORDER! ORDER! Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.The ROOM SETTLES DOWN. SPEAKER Our first order of business is an address by Colonel Harry Lee of the Continental Army.An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front ofthe assembly. He's COLONEL HARRY LEE, about Marion's ageand cut from the same cloth -- strong, weathered, with apowerful bearing. The room quiets down.Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marionreturns, stone-faced. Then Lee speaks, simply andclearly. LEE You all know why I am here. I am not an orator and I will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause. I am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from Philadelphia, it will soon be a formal state of war. In preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a Continental Army. I ask South Carolina to be the ninth. SIMMS Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at war, along with New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Virginia, but South Carolina is not at war. LEE Massachusetts and New Hampshire are not as far from South Carolina as you might think and the war they're fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies. It's for the independence of a nation. WITHINGTON And what nation is that?Robinson, one of the Patriots, stands up. ROBINSON An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission? LEE Please. ROBINSON Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists. It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away. LEE Thank you. Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.Laughter. Marion rises. MARION Mister Robinson, tell me, why should I trade one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one mile away?Laughter from the Loyalists. Surprise from Lee and thePatriots. In the gallery, Gabriel winces. ROBINSON Sir? MARION An elected legislature can trample a man's rights just as easily as a King can. LEE Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot. MARION It's Mister Marion. LEE I understood him to be a Patriot as well.More laughter. MARION If you mean by a Patriot, am I angry at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp Act? Then I'm a Patriot. And what of the Navigation Act? Should I be permitted to sell my tobacco to the French traders on Martinique? Yes, and it's an intrusion into my affairs that I can't... legally.Laughter. MARION And what of the greedy, self-serving bastards who sit as Magistrates on the Admiralty Court and have fined nearly every man in this room. Should they be boxed about the ears and thrown onto the first ship back to England? I'll do it myself. (beat) And do I believe that the American colonies should stand as a separate, independent nation, free from the reins of King and Parliament? I do, and if that makes a Patriot, then I'm a Patriot.Marion grows more serious. MARION But if you're asking whether I'm willing to go to war with England, the answer is, no. I've been to war and I have no desire to do so again.The room is quiet, the Assemblymen having been thrown off-balance. Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by hisfather's speech. ROBINSON This from the same Captain Francis Marion whose anger was so famous during the Wilderness Campaign.Marion glares at Robinson, then smiles. MARION I was intemperate in my youth. My departed wife, God bless her soul, dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility.Robinson looks derisively at Marion. ROBINSON Temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear.Marion bristles but before he can answer, Lee steps in. LEE Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign. We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life. ROBINSON I stand corrected. LEE Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...Lee's oratorical skills peter out. LEE Damn it, Francis! How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war? MARION Harry, Harry, Harry...Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing morethan two old friends, pissed off. LEE My hairy arse! You live in a cave if you think we'll get independence without war...The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL. SPEAKER Gentlemen! Please! This is not a tavern! MARION Wasn't it a Union Jack we fought under? LEE A long time ago... MARION Thirteen years... LEE That's a damn long time...The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again. SPEAKER Gentlemen! Please!Marion and Lee ignore the speaker. MARION You were an Englishman then... LEE I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watchthe argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneousanticipation of each rejoinder. MARION We don't have to go to war to gain independence... LEE Balderdash! MARION There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal... LEE Name five hundred. MARION Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery... LEE That's five, keep going... MARION ... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery... LEE You said bribery twice...Marion speaks slowly and firmly. MARION We do not have to go to war to gain independence.Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks moreseriously, quietly, grimly. LEE Francis, I was at Bunker Hill. It was as bad as anything you and I saw on the frontier. Worse than the slaughter at the Ashuelot River. The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range. And still, they advanced and they took the ground. That is the measure of their resolve. If your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way. It has come to that.Marion is silent for a long moment. He softens, findshimself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he everwanted to. MARION I have seven children. My wife is dead. Who's to care for them if I go to war?Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show ofweakness. At first Lee has no answer, then: LEE Wars are not fought only by childless men. A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles. MARION That's what I'm doing. I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead. LEE And your principles? MARION I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stareat him, appalled. Marion, feeling weak, sits down. Leelooks at his friend with more sympathy thandisappointment. Then Lee turns to Robinson who addressesthe chair. ROBINSON Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on a levy to the Continental Army. HAMILL Second. SPEAKER So moved.The vote is taken on a roll call. Gabriel watches fromthe gallery. SPEAKER Mr. Robinson. ROBINSON Yea. SPEAKER Mr. Hamill. HAMILL Yea. SPEAKER Mr. Johnson. JOHNSON Yea. SPEAKER Mr. Simms. SIMMS Nay. SPEAKER Mr. Marion.No response. SPEAKER Mr. Marion. MARION Nay.In the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out. The roll callcontinues. Marion sits, eyes straight ahead.EXT. ASSEMBLY HALL - DAYThe crowd waits. The doors open and a PAGE BOY dashes outand runs to the Continental Captain at the recruitingtable. PAGE BOY Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy passed!The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron.They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air.Other soldiers, STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES ANDDRUMS. Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table,YELLING and jostling for position.The delegates walk out. Both Patriots and Loyalists giveMarion a wide berth.Marion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at therecruiting table. Marion walks up to him. GABRIEL Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle. MARION When you have children, I hope you'll understand. GABRIEL When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.Marion looks closely at Gabriel. MARION Do you intend to enlist without my permission? GABRIEL Yes.They lock eyes for a moment, then Gabriel turns from hisfather and walks away, joining the crush around therecruiting table.Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos. The FIFESAND DRUMS continue to play. Marion doesn't hear them.Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphantgroup of Patriots who look at Marion coldly.Lee excuses himself, and steps over next to Marion. Leesees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistmenttable. LEE One of yours? MARION Gabriel. LEE I recognize him now. Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age? MARION No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother. LEE I'll see to it that he serves under me. MARION Thank you.They shake hands. Then Lee walks over to the soldiers.Marion takes a last look at Gabriel, then heads offthrough the crowded square, moving against the tide of menheaded toward the recruiting table.EXT. POND BLUFF - DAYSpringtime. The apple tree at the top of the hill iscovered with blossoms.SUPERIMPOSITION: "TWO YEARS LATER"EXT. FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAYMarion plows a field. Nathan leads the plowhorse. Samuelfollows, breaking up the clods of dirt. Hard work. Theystop to catch their breath. A SOFT WIND blows.Marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice.He hears nothing. He snaps the reins and continuesplowing.INT. MARION'S ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOONDark. Thomas steps up into the attic. He finds a trunkand opens it. Lifting out some blankets, he uncovers atrove of Marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat,a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into itsscabbard.Thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrowshoulders. He stands in front of a dusty mirror,appraising himself, then stops as he hears FOOTSTEPScoming up the stairs.It's Marion, tired and dirty from his plowing. Thomasgrimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shakehis head gently. MARION Not yet, Thomas. THOMAS When?Marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesyof really thinking about the answer. MARION Seventeen. THOMAS But it's already been two years and that's two more years. The war could be over by then. MARION God willing.Thomas considers it, then nods. THOMAS Alright. Seventeen.Marion offers his hand. They shake firmly, like adults.Marion takes the coat off Thomas and puts it back in thetrunk. They walk down the stairs together.INT. POND BLUFF - DAWNAll is quiet. A dawn mist hovers close over the ground.Some sparrows feed at the base of the apple tree near thegravesite. DISTANT THUNDER. Low and rolling. The birdsstop feeding, uneasy, then fly away.INT. MARION'S BEDROOM - DAWNAt another roll of the DISTANT THUNDER Marion awakes. Hegets out of bed and pulls on his clothes.EXT. FRONT PORCH - MARION'S HOUSE - DAWNMarion steps out to his front porch and listens. He knowsthe sound, the DISTANT STACCATO BOOMS OF CANNON and thePATTERING WAVE OF THOUSANDS OF MUSKETS FIRING.One by one the children join him. Thomas, Nathan andSamuel listen analytically. Margaret and Susan pressclose against their father. William looks curiously atthe cloudless sky. WILLIAM Is it going to rain? THOMAS That's not thunder.The SOUND BECOMES DEEPER, MORE OMINOUS. They all noticethe change. NATHAN Father? MARION Six-pounders. Lots of them. MARGARET How far away? MARION Four, five miles. SAMUEL Waxhaus? MARION Just east of it. MARGARET Are we safe here?Marion puts on a smile. MARION Don't worry. MARGARET We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west. MARION No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads. We're safer here.Thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets. Hegives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father. MARION Put those away. THOMAS But father, they might come this way. MARION Put them away.Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house. MARION Enough. I'll be in the workshop. Samuel, the cows. Thomas, attend to your studies here on the porch. Nathan, on the back porch. If you see anyone, come get me. Margaret, please keep William close to you. No one is to go past the yard wall.They all nod. Marion walks off toward the workshop,followed by Susan. The others hesitate. MARION Children.They head off to do as they were told.INT. WORKSHOP - DAYMarion works the lathe. Susan watches from her perch onthe woodpile.EXT. BARN - DAYThe SOUND OF A CRASH from inside the barn. An angry cowruns out of the barn, dragging a tenacious Samuel who isholding onto the cow's neck.Samuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt. The cowruns about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on thebank of the river. Samuel grabs a rope and heads down thehill to get the cow.ON THE RIVERBANKAs Samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishlyapproaching then retreating from the water. Then he seesthe cause -- the water in the river has a pale, pink hue.Samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is.Behind him, Margaret sees her brother beyond the yardwall. MARGARET Samuel...He doesn't respond. Margaret, trailed by William, walksdown toward Samuel. MARGARET Samuel, get up to the house. You heard father...Then she sees it, too. The pale pink is turning redderand redder. And then the BODIES. First one, then more,many more. Torn apart. Missing limbs. Those with wide-open wounds, are already drained of blood. Others arestill seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler redof the surrounding water.Samuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled andfascinated.MARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children atthe river. He can't see what they're looking at.Irritated, he walks toward them. Then, as he nears theriver, he sees the color of the water and the bodies thathave hypnotized his children. He quickens his stride,speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them. MARION Up to the house, now. All of you, come on. Now.EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHTQuiet. Dark. Marion stands on the front porch, lookingout into the night, listening, hearing nothing. Heglances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes fromthe Big Dipper to the NORTH STAR.BEHIND THE HOUSE, A FIGURE IN THE DARKNESS, carrying amusket, moves from shadow to shadow.INT. KITCHEN - NIGHTMargaret and Samuel and William talk, their voices low. SAMUEL They're going to come. MARGARET Quiet. SAMUEL We're going to have to fight them off. WILLIAM Father will do that. SAMUEL They'll probably kill us men and do Lord knows what to you women. MARGARET Samuel!A SOUND. They all stop. Something moved behind thekitchen. Margaret silently eases the others out of theroom, through the darkened hall toward their father.SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF THEM, A BLOODY FIGUREBig. Hulking. In uniform. Margaret SCREAMS. Williamand Samuel CRY OUT. The figure moves toward them...Marion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into thehouse. He sees the figure, moves toward it...THE FIGURE MOVES INTO THE LIGHT... Marion sees thebloodied face... MARION Gabriel!Gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty. He carries amusket and a dispatch case. He sways. Marion catches himand eases him to a seat. MARGARET You're hurt. THOMAS The battle, were you there? MARION Margaret, get bandages and water. Thomas, the porch, eyes open.Marion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but notlife-threatening. GABRIEL Have you seen any Redcoats? MARION Not yet. What happened?Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertlycleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings. GABRIEL It wasn't like Saratoga. There, we stayed in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats. They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw. I was given these dispatches... I saw Virginia Regulars surrender... as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits... killed them all, over two hundred men.Marion's appalled. MARION They had surrendered?Gabriel nods. Marion's stunned. Gabriel tries to rise. GABRIEL I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro. MARION You're in no condition to ride. GABRIEL I have no choice, I...Gabriel passes out. Marion catches him and carries him toa day-bed in the parlor. As Marion lays him down, theyhear HEAVY MUSKET FIRE, VERY CLOSE.Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night,the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight.A SKIRMISH IN THE FIELD BELOW THE HOUSEPitch black. Then a MUSKET FIRES, creating a FLASH OFLIGHT that illuminates a tableau of soldiers, about threedozen Redcoats and as many Patriots.The strobe of the musket shot provides targets for anensuing VOLLEY OF SHOTS in every direction. Thendarkness, punctuated by SCREAMS OF PAIN, CONFUSEDHOLLERING and the RUSTLING OF ARMED MEN IN MOVEMENT.Then the pattern repeats itself: A MUSKET FIRES,illuminating a tableau of targets for another MURDEROUSVOLLEY OF SHOTS. MARION Margaret, take William and Susan down to the root cellar. Thomas, go to the back porch. Nathan and Samuel, the side windows. Keep out of sight.They hurry off. Marion steps into the house and opens hisgun cabinet. He extracts two pistols and a pair ofmuskets. Then he steps back to the front door. He waitsand watches.EXT. LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAWNFirst light. The morning mist lies low over the field.Marion warily approaches the scene of the battle. Hecarries a Pennsylvania rifle, has another slung over hisshoulder, and has a pair of pistols in his belt.As Marion nears the field he sees, appearing out of thelow mist, a nightmarish vision. Young Redcoats andContinentals are scattered on the ground, dead andwounded. Many have been hideously torn apart by themassive musket balls. Blood is everywhere. Marionhurries back toward the house.EXT. LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - MORNINGMarion loads the wounded men onto a wagon, helped byThomas, Nathan and Samuel.EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - POND BLUFF - DAYThe porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital.There are about two dozen wounded, a few more Patriotsthan Redcoats.

William and Susan watch frominside.Marion treats an arm wound, retying a tourniquet,stanching an ugly flow of blood.Marion moves to the next of the wounded. Thomas starts tohelp but Marion shakes his head. MARION He's dead...Marion moves on to another. MARION Thomas, help me turn him over...They turn over a young Continental and see a horriblewound on his back. Thomas, swoons. MARION Thomas!A hard glare from Marion strengthens his son. Togetherthey bandage the wounded man.EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - AFTERNOONTriage completed. Margaret and Samuel give water andfood. Marion kneels next to a CONTINENTAL SERGEANT and aCOUPLE OF PRIVATES who are less severely wounded than theothers. CONTINENTAL SERGEANT Thank you.Marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks. MARION Sergeant, there are seventeen wounded men here. Seven Redcoats and ten Patriots, counting my son inside. That puts me in a difficult position.The Continental Sergeant knows what's coming. ThePrivates and Marion's children don't. MARION You three are the least severely wounded. I have to ask you to leave and find care elsewhere.The Privates are stunned at the request. The Sergeantlooks at Marion's children and nods. SERGEANT I understand.He struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the twoPrivates to do the same. SERGEANT Come on, boys.Nathan, Samuel and Margaret are confused. THOMAS Father? NATHAN But they're wounded. MARION There are rules, even in war.Marion motions to a large, old scar on his arm. MARION After the Battle of Ashuelot River, against the French, I got this and the one on my leg. I couldn't walk. Washington had to march north. He left me with other wounded men and a like number of French prisoners. Nine for nine. When the French found us, their surgeon gave me the best of care. We'll be safe this way.Marion's children are not convinced. The Sergeant and thetwo Privates gather themselves to leave. MARION Your best chance is in Bennington, seven miles east, along the river road.The wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road. MARION Thank you.Marion and his children watch them go.EXT. POND BLUFF ROAD - DAYA dirt road runs along the edge of the Santee Swamps,stretching toward green, rolling hills beyond. Beautifulcountry. Peaceful. Then, the GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE. ATHUNDEROUS SOUND rises, louder and louder. HORSES HOOVES.From around a bend, a detachment of cavalry gallops:British GREEN DRAGOONS. The finest light calvary in theworld. Hard, strong men. Excellent horsemen. Theirmounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for. TheDragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked withthe blood and dirt of a recent battle. Tired andvigorous.They're armed to the teeth. Each carries a flintlockcarbine, a brace of pistols and a sword. Some carrylances as well. Regimental flags flutter. They are fortyof the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable.And at their head, the most imposing man of all, LT.COLONEL BANASTRE TARLETON. "The Butcher." Aristocratic.Strong. Dark. A powerful horseman on the best mount ofthe entire troop. Decorated. Imperious. No temper, justhard, cold authority. His men struggle to keep up withhim.Behind them, two dozen LOYALIST MILITIA CALVARY (Americancivilians loyal to the crown). Nasty, local men.Civilian clothes. Riding at their head is AMOS GASKINS,grizzled, lower-class, wearing ill-fitting patrician'sclothing.AROUND A BENDThe three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farmhear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road,raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender.The Green Dragoons rein in. Tarleton stops in front ofthe three men. He motions for one of his men to lower hisweapon. Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the woundedmen. TARLETON You're surrendering. CONTINENTAL SERGEANT Yes, sir. TARLETON What unit? CONTINENTAL SERGEANT First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton. TARLETON Who cared for your wounds?They hesitate. CONTINENTAL SERGEANT We did. TARLETON With a lace table cloth?Tarleton turns to his second-in-command, MAJOR WILKINS. TARLETON Kill them.Tarleton rides off. Wilkins and several other Dragoonscalmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS, killing the three Patriots.The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of thethree men.EXT. POND BLUFF - DAYMarion and his children tend the wounded. Gabriel, weakbut walking, helps. REDCOAT INFANTRY appears out of thewoods, heading toward the house. Three dozen men. Scoutsand flank units covering the main body. Marion gathershis family around him, stands and waits.The Redcoats get to the house, warily eye the wounded andMarion's family. A young REDCOAT LIEUTENANT motions hismen to check out the house and barn, then looks at thewounded, doing a silent count. He turns to Marion. REDCOAT LIEUTENANT These men are of my regiment. Thank you.Marion nods. ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the housecarrying Gabriel's dispatch case. REDCOAT Rebel dispatches, sir.Gabriel steps up. GABRIEL I carried those. I was wounded, these people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches. REDCOAT LIEUTENANT I understand.The SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES. All turn and see:TARLETON AND THE GREEN DRAGOONSThundering down the road toward the house. It's animpressive, frightening sight.They rein in their horses, stopping in the yard, envelopedby their trailing cloud of dust.Tarleton surveys the scene, then speaks to the youngRedcoat Lieutenant. TARLETON Lieutenant, have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing. Use whatever horses and wagons you can find here. REDCOAT LIEUTENANT Yes, sir.He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton. REDCOAT LIEUTENANT We found this, sir.Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents. TARLETON Who carried this? GABRIEL I did. TARLETON (to Lt. re: Gabriel) Take this one to Camden, he's a spy. He will be hung.Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel. MARION Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and that's a marked dispatch case.Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to theLieutenant. TARLETON Fire the house and barns. REDCOAT LIEUTENANT Yes, sir. MARION Colonel... REDCOAT LIEUTENANT And the Rebel wounded? TARLETON Kill them.The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shockedby the order. Marion is, also, but he's more concernedwith Gabriel. He pushes past some Redcoats and stands atTarleton's mount, looking up. MARION A dispatch rider with a marked case cannot be held for spying.Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion. He looks downat his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles. TARLETON We're not going to hold him, we're going to hang him. MARION But...Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion.Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burlyRedcoat Corporal. GABRIEL Father... TARLETON Oh, he's your son. You should have taught him about loyalty. MARION Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider. By the rules of war, a dispatch rider with a marked case...Tarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistoltrained on Marion's face. TARLETON Would you like a lesson in the rules of war?Marion doesn't answer. He looks up at Tarleton coldly,taking his measure, waiting to see if he's going to pullthe trigger.Tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts hisaim, pointing the pistol among Marion's children. TARLETON Perhaps your children would.The children are terrified. Thomas is more angry thanfrightened. Marion quickly steps between the pistol andhis children and speaks quietly to Tarleton. MARION No lesson is necessary.Tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces ofMarion's children. He smiles at the effect. Then heholsters his pistol.Marion and his children watch as one of the Redcoats tiesGabriel's hands. Thomas is beside himself. THOMAS Father, do something.Thomas grows increasingly agitated. He sees that hisfather is going to do nothing. He gauges the distancebetween Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods.Then suddenly, Thomas SPRINGS. He RUNS, THROWING HIMSELF,into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel, KNOCKING THEM DOWN. THOMAS Gabriel! Run!Gabriel is too shocked to take flight. A few of theRedcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shaketheir heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectualgesture. One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of theneck and yanks him to his feet.TARLETON sees the commotion. Without pausing he DRAWS HISPISTOL AND FIRES, HITTING THOMAS IN THE BACK.THOMAS is thrown to his knees by the shot. Stunned,confused, he looks down and sees the massive exit wound inhis chest.MARION, horrified, catches Thomas as he falls, easing himto the ground.MARGARET CRIES OUT. THE OTHER CHILDREN are stunned tosilence.The REDCOATS are frozen in place. Tarleton's GREENDRAGOONS are impassive, having seen worse.MARION holds his son, looking at the huge,incomprehensible wound. He knows that Thomas is alreadydead, though his body still moves.MARION'S stunned agony turns to fury. He rises, his eyestrained on Tarleton, then stops as...TARLETON raises a second loaded pistol and a DOZEN GREENDRAGOONS raise pistols and carbines, aiming them at Marionand his children.MARION FREEZES, torn between his fury and fear for hisother children. He locks his eyes on Tarleton.TARLETON calmly baths in Marion's anger. Then, with ahard yank of the reins, he jerks his horse's head aroundand utters a sharp command to Wilkins. TARLETON Major.Tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without lookingback. His GREEN DRAGOONS THUNDER after him.MARION'S CHILDREN begin to cry. Margaret tries to reviveThomas' lifeless body, gently caressing his cheek. MARGARET Thomas, please, Thomas...The Redcoats watch in silence. MARION LOOKS AT GABRIELand turns to the Redcoat Lieutenant. MARION Lieutenant, please...The Lieutenant wavers, but he looks after the departingTarleton and his resolve stiffens. He turns coldly toMarion. REDCOAT LIEUTENANT I have my orders. Sergeant!The Redcoat infantrymen scatter, some to get horses andwagons from the barn, others to torch the buildings.MARION stands among the children, all of whom look toMarion with pleading eyes, waiting for him to dosomething. MARGARET Papa, look what they did to Thomas... NATHAN Father, they're going to take Gabriel...With stone-faced fury, Marion watches the Redcoats dotheir work.From the barns, they hear the sounds of MUSKETS FIRING andthe SQUEALS OF THE LIVESTOCK being killed.Other REDCOATS TORCH THE HOUSE, BARN AND OUTBUILDINGS.THE FLAMES RISE.The Redcoats bring out Marion's wagons and carriages andbegin loading the Redcoat wounded.The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men walk amongthe Patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet,begging for mercy. The Redcoats quickly OPEN FIRE, as ifto get it over with.The WOUNDED PATRIOTS CRY OUT. More SHOTS. Then SILENCE.GABRIEL, his hands bound behind him, looks to his fatherwith a combination of resoluteness and fear. Marion lockseyes with him. NATHAN Father, you can't let them take him... MARION Quiet.MARION AND THE CHILDRENWatch as the Redcoats form up and move out, leadingGabriel on a tether. Gabriel looks back helplessly but ahard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns himaround. They disappear around a bend in the road.THE INSTANT THE REDCOATS ARE OUT OF SIGHT, MARION speaksfirmly to his weeping children. MARION Don't move.MARION STRIDES to his front door and ENTERS THE BURNINGHOUSE.INSIDE, FIRE EVERYWHERE. Picking a route between theflames, Marion walks to his gun cabinet. He opens it andpulls out weapons -- two Pennsylvania rifles, two muskets,two pistols, a long-bladed knife and a worn tomahawk. Hecarries them, with powder horns and ammunition pouchesback toward the door.Marion walks OUT OF THE BURNING HOUSE. MARION Nathan, Samuel...Without breaking stride, Marion throws muskets to Nathanand Samuel who catch them. MARION Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed. Hide there. If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm. Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel. MARGARET But what about Thomas? MARION Leave him. Take care of William and Susan.Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuelfollow. Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susantoward the river. The house is enveloped in flames.EXT. WOODED PATH - AFTERNOONMarion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steadypace. Nathan and Samuel run behind, less winded thantheir father. Marion makes up with cold fury what helacks in youth.EXT. WOODED HILLSIDE - AFTERNOONMarion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill. Slows.Crawls the last few feet. Nathan and Samuel just behindhim. Looks over the hillside.A path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below.Marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking foradvantage. He points. MARION Nathan, there. Samuel, there.The boys go where they're told. MARION I'll fire first. Then, Nathan, kill whoever is standing closest to Gabriel. Samuel, kill the last man in the line.They stagger under the weight of the orders. Marionnotices but continues. MARION After that, Samuel, load for Nathan. If something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you can, that way, downhill. Hide in the brush by the river, then make your way home, get the others and go to Aunt Charlotte's farm.The boys hesitate. Marion looks at them firmly. MARION Boys... steady. NATHAN & SAMUEL Yes, father.Marion disappears into the underbrush.DOWN THE PATHThe dozen Redcoats approach. Leading Gabriel on the rope.AHEAD OF THEMMarion waits in the thick undergrowth.On the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets andexchange a frightened, troubled look.The REDCOATS enter the glen.MARION waits, then picks his moment and FIRES, killing theRedcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest.NATHAN AND SAMUEL INSTANTLY FIRE, dropping the lastRedcoat in the line and the one holding Gabriel's rope.THE REDCOATS STOP in confusion...GABRIEL kneels, out of the line of fire.The REDCOAT SERGEANT takes command... REDCOAT SERGEANT FORM BY TWOS! BACK-TO-BACK LINES...MARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat...Samuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan whoFIRES, DROPPING ANOTHER REDCOAT. REDCOAT CORPORAL READY...Marion FIRES, killing the Corporal, the last man ofrank...Marion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKETFIRE tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke...FROM THIS MOMENT ON, MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING. Hestrides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush,offering only glimpses of himself. He changes his paceand direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing andloading while moving. He never gives the Redcoats astationary target, especially one marked by billowingsmoke from his flintlock. It's an Indian tactic and itworks.The Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about tofire... Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION,several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS.Six Redcoats left. Some primed, some reloading. AREDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground andFIRES, killing him.Samuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket toNathan who FIRES...The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BYNATHAN'S SMOKE...Marion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS. Heinstantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats'attention from his sons...Marion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats...One Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him,shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with thebutt of the musket...This is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion,killing with stunning brutality...Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THEREDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shovesthat musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES...Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading...MARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCINGBAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open...Splattering himself with BLOOD...The final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks intothe woods... Marion tears after him...A FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THEBRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground...A CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of thetrees on the far side...MARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air andSINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK...Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanksback his head and SLITS HIS THROAT...Then, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk fromthe Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons...AT THE GLENNathan and a weeping Samuel, stunned at the carnage,stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel. Marion runs upand motions for them to stop.Marion, checks the Redcoats, making sure they're all dead. MARION Samuel, reload. Nathan, untie Gabriel.They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket andscans the road and the underbrush. In a moment they'reready. Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then heand his sons disappear into the underbrush.EXT. POND BLUFF - DAYThe house and barns smolder. Thomas' body lies in theyard.

HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAYMarion digs a grave. The children watch. The only soundsare Marion's labored BREATHING, the RASP OF THE SHOVEL andthe RUSTLE OF DEAD LEAVES blown along the ground by a softwind.Some dry leaves catch on Thomas' still wet blood, as iftrying to bandage his wound.EXT. HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY (LATER)Marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave.Near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns toElizabeth's gravestone. The soft wind blows. Marionlistens.He turns and sees his children looking up at him. Holdingin his own tears, he gathers the children around him andlet's them cry. MARION There, there... he's alright... he's with your mother now...He stiffens, speaking formally: MARION Lord, we pray that You accept this child, Thomas Marion and give him a place at Your side with his mother. We ask that You embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which Your mercy works. This we ask, in Your name. Amen. MARION'S CHILDREN Amen.Marion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently easeshis children away.EXT. BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAYMarion and his children stop at the overlook, seeing theSantee River valley spread out before them. The SMOKEfrom two dozen farms rises. GABRIEL The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams, Stantons...The smoke from the separate fires joins together high inthe sky, forming what looks like stormclouds. They walkon.EXT.

GABRIEL Father, it's safe.Marion hustles the children out of the woods.INT. BEDROOM - NIGHTCharlotte sits, holding a sleeping Susan. The otherchildren lie awake on pallets. Marion, still streakedwith dried blood and sweat, tucks William and Margaretinto bed. MARION Sleep, now.Marion moves on to Nathan. NATHAN Father... I killed those men... MARION Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do. NATHAN I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...Marion isn't. He turns to Samuel who's cried-out. Marionreaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion'sblood-streaked hand. Marion sighs and tucks him in. MARION Try to get some sleep.Marion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes herhead. CHARLOTTE I'll stay with them.Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children.INT. CHARLOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHTMarion enters. He starts to pace but grows unsteady. Herears back as if screaming but no sound comes from hismouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children aresearching for the solace of sleep.He opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, poursand drinks. Then another.THE SOUND OF HORSEMEN. Gabriel walks in. Tired. Grim. GABRIEL How are they?Marion just shakes his head. GABRIEL Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental Army. I'll leave in the morning to join him.Marion nods. Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for along moment, neither one finding words. Then Gabrielspeaks softly. GABRIEL I'll tend my horse.He leaves Marion alone.INT. CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)Marion stares at the fireplace. Charlotte walks incarrying a pitcher and fresh clothing. CHARLOTTE They're asleep.Marion is silent. Charlotte pours water into a washbowland motions to Marion. He takes off his shirt. Shebegins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound onhis neck. MARION How did this... how did I let this happen? CHARLOTTE You couldn't have known. MARION I should have known... once I would have...

PORCH - CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - MORNINGMarion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses. Marionembraces Nathan and Samuel. Then he turns to Margaret,William and Susan. WILLIAM When will you be back? MARION I don't know, William. WILLIAM Tomorrow?Marion winces. Margaret puts her arm around William. MARGARET No, not tomorrow.Marion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying tocoax a word out of the silent four-year-old: MARION Goodbye?She just looks at him. MARION Just one word? Goodbye? That's all I want.Susan shakes her head. He sighs, rises and turns toCharlotte. They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeplybut a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a momentlonger than one would expect. She looks up at him... hekisses her on the cheek.Marion mounts up. And he and Gabriel head off, Susan,unnoticed and unheard, whispers: SUSAN Goodbye.Marion and Gabriel ride away.EXT. CAMDEN ROAD - DAYMarion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a smallskirmish. Bodies. Abandoned wagons. Dead horses. Aburning farm.EXT. CAMDEN HILLSIDE - DAYMarion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill. A vistaspreads out before them. They see an awesome sight -- AMASSIVE SLASH OF RED approaches a MASSIVE SLASH OF BLUE.A battle is taking place about five miles away.Gabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him. MARION No, it's too late.Gabriel stops. Marion points out brightly coloredclusters of men behind each army. MARION Command posts... Patriot... British...The distant slash of red stops. Marion and Gabriel hearonly a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS.Then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, asudden, silent eruption of white smoke.An instant later, the blue slash quivers. A moment laterthe SOUND OF THE CANNONS, RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rollsover Marion and Gabriel.The RED SLASH STOPS moving. It darkens as thousands ofRedcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneelinto firing position.Marion's eyes dart. He knows what's coming. MARION Break for the trees... break for the trees...A MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the redslash. An instant later, the blue line starts to break upas hundreds of distant Patriots fall.The SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion andGabriel like the pattering of rain.Then the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE, SCATTERED VOLLEYS eruptsfrom the Patriot lines. The red line holds firm. MARION Send them to cover! Goddamn you!But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field.From behind the Redcoats, FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSESmove quickly onto the battlefield. CAVALRY. GABRIEL Father, we have to do something...The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shatteringit. Tiny bits of blue move in every direction. GABRIEL Father... MARION It's already over.Marion watches, appalled. At this distance the movingslashes of color and billowing smoke are strangelybeautiful. Marion turns his horse and heads down thehill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines.EXT. AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTA nightmare. SCREAMS OF AGONY. A few hundred battered,Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to moveout. The battle, so bloodless and beautiful at adistance, has, in its aftermath, become horrificallypainful and ugly.Marion and Gabriel ride into camp, passing nervoussentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by poolsof blood and amputated legs and arms. Marion sees HARRYLEE at a make-shift command post, barking orders, tryingto pull things together. LEE Damn you, Sergeant, don't move the wounded twice, put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons. PATRIOT SERGEANT Yes, sir. LEE Lieutenant, detail men for outriders. We move out as soon as the wounded are ready. LIEUTENANT Yes, sir.The Lieutenant rushes off. Lee notices Marion andGabriel, surprised to see them. He jerks his head forthem to follow him into:LEE'S COMMAND TENTOnce out of sight of the men, Lee loses his commandbearing. Exhausted, he leans on his campaign table andlooks closely at Marion, asking with his eyes why Marionis here. MARION Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas. It was Tarleton himself. LEE I'm sorry. MARION I'm sorry I wasn't here for this. LEE There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool. MARION We saw. LEE I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle. He spent too many years in the British army. MARION Where is he now? LEE Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up. MARION Who's in command? LEE I am, I think. MARION What are my orders?Lee gives Marion a tired smile. LEE If you want orders, I've got some for you.Lee ROLLS OUT A MAP for Marion and Gabriel. LEE We're a breath away from losing this war. In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats. (pointing) Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back. He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York. MARION So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington. LEE And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield. (beat) Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive. A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga. The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops. MARION When? LEE Fall, six months at the earliest. MARION Long time. LEE The bigger problem is where, not when. The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms. MARION So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then. LEE Not me, you. I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks. MARION You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia? LEE Not held, just slowed down. MARION They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard. They'd be better off letting it move on. LEE They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be. MARION How many men does Cornwallis have under his command? LEE Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry... (beat) ... including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton.At the mention of Tarleton, Marion nods. MARION I'll do what I can.Lee quickly writes something. LEE I'm giving you a field commission as a colonel.He hands it to Marion. Gabriel steps forward. GABRIEL Colonel Lee, I request a transfer to Colonel Marion's command. LEE Granted.Lee scribbles another order and hands it to Gabriel. Thenhe turns to Marion. LEE Good luck.Marion nods. They duck out of the tent.EXT. AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT (LATER)Marion and Gabriel stand watching Lee and his Continentalregulars move out. Gabriel turns to Marion. GABRIEL What now, sir? MARION We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee... GABRIEL We'd cover more ground if we split up. MARION It's safer if we stay together.Gabriel steps in front of Marion. GABRIEL Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good. MARION Oh? GABRIEL I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston. MARION Is that so? GABRIEL Yes, sir. (beat) My father taught me.Marion looks at Gabriel closely. MARION Did your father teach you humility? GABRIEL He tried. It didn't take.Marion looks Gabriel up and down. MARION Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp. I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island. GABRIEL Yes, sir.They mount up. MARION And, Corporal... (beat) ... be careful. GABRIEL Yes... (beat) ... father.They ride off in different directions.EXT. BRADFORD VILLAGE - NIGHTMarion rides into a small village, passing several bodiesin blue Continental uniforms, hanging from lampposts.Marion stops in front of a tavern, dismounts and enters.INT. TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHTAs Marion walks in he's greeted by cold stares from half-a-dozen men, huddles over their drinks. MARION I'm looking for John Billings. BARTENDER He's dead.Marion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men. MARION If he comes back from the dead, tell him Francis Marion is looking for him. BARTENDER I'll be sure to do that.As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle ofMadeira on one of the tables. He stops. MARION I'll wait. Miracles happen.A stand-off. Then, a hulking FIGURE appears in theshadows at the back doorway. He's JOHN BILLINGS, big,coarse, about Marion's age. Billings jerks his head forMarion to join him in the back room.INT. BACK ROOM - TAVERN - NIGHTDark. Marion and billings talk over a bottle. BILLINGS You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia? MARION I expect to try. BILLINGS Trust you and Harry Lee. Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis? MARION It worked. How many men can you raise? BILLINGS Not many. Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose... (beat) What about you? You've got a lot to lose.Marion drains his glass and stands up. MARION You coming, or not?Billings drains his glass. They walk out together.EXT. TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHTMarion and Billings ride away from the tavern, passing thehanging Patriot bodies.EXT. SNOW'S ISLAND - SANTEE SWAMPS - NIGHTA CACOPHONY OF BIRDS AND INSECTS. Swamp maples andwillows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and poolsof plant-choked water.Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path thatsnakes through the swamp. They cross a narrow land bridgeonto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men,including Marion who kneels at a campfire.CLOSE SHOT: Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEADSOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan. The little men fall totheir knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, moltenmetal.The new arrivals dismount and greet the others.Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours thelead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the moldinto a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS. GABRIEL Father, this war is about more than Thomas.Marion doesn't look up. MARION Is it? GABRIEL If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself. MARION How old are you? GABRIEL You know how old I am. MARION God help us all when you're forty.Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan. Gabrielshakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse.EXT. SNOW'S ISLAND ENCAMPMENT - MORNINGDay breaks. A low, thick swamp mist covers theencampment. Marion, sits alone by the embers of lastnight's campfire. The men are awake. Some eat, otherstalk.Marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie. He takesthe bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouchattached to his weapons' belt. Then he rises and headsover to the men.He surveys his brigade. Twenty-six men: framers,artisans, mountain men, none in uniform. Marion walksamong them, nodding familiarly to several. He notices animposing looking Cherokee Indian, BROTHER JOSEPH, standinga bit apart from the others. They exchange nods.He notices a stern-looking man in partial clerical garb,REV. CHARLES OLIVER. MARION Reverend. REV. OLIVER I heard about your son. I'm sorry.Marion accepts his condolences. He notes GEORGE DALTON, atough-looking, rustic man with an ice-cold, distant stare. MARION Dalton.Dalton doesn't respond. Marion recognizes another face,ABNER BROWN, African-American, around thirty, rugged.Marion addresses the men who do not gather around so muchas just give him their attention. MARION You all have your own reasons for being here. I lost a son and I intend to kill the man who killed him...Marion pauses and looks over at Gabriel. MARION ... But I don't consider that man's life adequate payment for the life of my son, and killing him won't keep the sons of other men from dying...Gabriel nods, approvingly. MARION Cornwallis has to move north. We have to keep him right here. If he's south of the Chesapeake when the French arrive, if the French arrive, we have a chance of winning this war.Marion looks from face to face. MARION Eat, get some rest, we move out in two hours.Marion heads back to his campsite, passing Gabriel withoutlooking at him, but very aware of his son's eyes on him.EXT.

CORNWALLIS Gentlemen.The officers gather around the map. CORNWALLIS Major, this is not an adequate map. MAJOR HUNTINGTON We have better coming on the trailing supply convoy from Charleston. CORNWALLIS A useful place for our maps. MAJOR HUNTINGTON I'm sorry, sir, it won't happen again.Tarleton enters, followed by Wilkins. CORNWALLIS My harrier. Join us, Colonel. TARLETON Sir.Tarleton and Wilkins join them around the map. CORNWALLIS Gentlemen, celebration is premature. We have a difficult campaign ahead of us. We are in predominately hostile country and we cannot rely on forage. As we move north, the bulk of our supplies will reach us by sea, through Charleston, which will give us a long and vulnerable supply line, one that can only be secured if the locals are loyal to the crown. CORNWALLIS' OFFICERS (multiple) Yes, sir.Cornwallis turns to his field officers, paying particularattention to Tarleton. CORNWALLIS Nonetheless, we must remember that this is a civil war...Tarleton proudly holds Cornwallis' look. CORNWALLIS These colonials are our brethren and when this conflict is over, we will be reestablishing commerce with them. Surrendering troops will be given quarter and unwarranted assaults on civilians will cease.Wilkins shifts uneasily. Tarleton isn't cowed. CORNWALLIS I expect this war to be fought in a vigorous but civilized manner.Cornwallis looks at his other officers. CORNWALLIS Have I made myself clear, gentlemen? OFFICERS (multiple) Yes, sir.Cornwallis shifts his eyes back to Tarleton who was notamong those who spoke. Tarleton pointedly pauses amoment, then says: TARLETON Yes, sir.Cornwallis turns his attention back to the map. His mengather around.EXT. CORNWALLIS' FIELD HEADQUARTERS - CAMDEN - DAYTarleton and Wilkins walk out and mount up. WILKINS I believe he was speaking to us, Colonel.

OLIVER ... two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping... BILLINGS We have enough arms for an army. Now all we need is an army.Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT andROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen. Theyoverlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language ofcolonial artisans. SCOTT Reamer, boring tool... MARION Swage, broach, etching tool... FIELDING A rolling gunsmith's shop... SCOTT We can rifle those musket barrels... FIELDING Get another hundred yards out of 'em... MARION We'll need a forge... SCOTT Easy enough... MARION We've got clay to make a chamber... FIELDING Oak to make charcoal... SCOTT Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows... MARION And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it, rig a piston and drive shaft and we'll have a flywheel to power the bellows...Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look. SCOTT (to Fielding) That's why he's a colonel.Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work.Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MENand strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGEGREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons. BILLINGS Shoot them! Shoot the damn things!Dalton prepares to do so. MARION Put that pistol down! SCOTT They followed us from the bridge. They won't let anyone near the wagon.Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to thedogs. MARION Stay... stay... stay...The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out histhroat. MARION Don't you growl at me!The dogs decide to obey. Marion lets them sniff his hand,then firmly pats them. MARION Now let's see what's in this wagon.Rev. Oliver and Abner join him. Billings eases past thedogs. Abner opens a large case and finds it filled withbottles. ABNER Rum, French Champagne, Madeira, Port... BILLINGS No wonder they were guarding it.Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powderedwigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig-stands. Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical casesand finds it filled with papers. REV. OLIVER My heavens, personal correspondence of... Lord Cornwallis.Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matchingcases on nearby wagons. MARION These four wagons must be his. GABRIEL And the dogs, too, I'll wager. BILLINGS I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding. MARION His journals, letters, maps, books...Abner calls from another wagon. ABNER Colonel, we got a wagon full of officer's uniforms and more powder and muskets here.Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pileof Cornwallis' papers and starts to read.EXT. SNOW'S ISLAND - NIGHTMarion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk,reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis'field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oilpaintings and an elaborate folding commode. The TWO GREATDANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily.The men have divided themselves into two groups, onecoarse, the other civilized, each clustered around aseparate fire.The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph andRANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drinkand laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew.The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott,Fielding and Abner, talk quietly.Marion puts down the journal and walks over to thecampfire where the rougher men are gathered. He standsjust inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that allcan hear: MARION Today was hard earned but a good start.Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men aswell. MARION In the future wounded British soldiers will be given quarters. DALTON Like they gave quarter to my family? My wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came. The Redcoats locked the door and torched the house. MARION You have my sympathy... but the order stands. DALTON And who are you to give an order like that? We all know what you did after Fort Wilderness.That hits home but Marion remains calm. MARION I'm your commanding officer. This is militia, not regular army. I can't hold you here, but as long as you stay, you'll follow my orders.Marion looks from face to face. Most begrudgingly nod.That's enough for Marion.As he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted byRev. Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the othermen, except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear. REV. OLIVER Thank you. MARION For what? REV. OLIVER For trying to impose some decency on that sort. MARION Don't depend on my decency. I'm one of that sort.Marion walks on. Rev. Oliver exchanges a look withGabriel, then heads off. As Marion joins Gabriel andBillings at his campfire, Billings grips his bottle. BILLINGS Am I one of that sort? MARION You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.Billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a longdrink. He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equallylong drink. Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle. MARION I'm going to check the watch.He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel andBillings at the campfire. GABRIEL He shouldn't make light. That Redcoat should not have been killed. BILLINGS He's not making light.Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look. BILLINGS You don't know him very well, do you? GABRIEL He's my father.Billings looks closely at Gabriel. GABRIEL I know him well enough? BILLINGS Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier. It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire.EXT. SNOW'S ISLAND - DAWNThe men are beginning to stir, gathering around thecampfires, cooking, using pots, pans and other gear fromthe stolen British wagons.Marion reads Cornwallis' journal. He looks up, stretchesand walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings andRev. Oliver cook. The dogs follow at a distance. BILLINGS Well? MARION I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes. BILLINGS Cheerful news to greet the morn. MARION His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically. But he has a weakness.They all turn to Marion. MARION Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness is that he knows it. GABRIEL Father? MARION Pride is his weakness.The men consider that. BILLINGS Personally, I'd prefer stupidity. MARION Pride will do.BEGIN MONTAGE: Series of shots as follows:-- A VOLLEY OF MUSKET FIRE erupts from some thick underbrush, cutting down half of a squadron of Redcoats on the march. The surviving Redcoats FIRE BACK into the trees at unseen targets to little effect.-- Marion rides with about fifty men.-- A British supply convoy makes its way through the woods.

CORNWALLIS Why am I here, Colonel Halbert? MAJOR HALBERT For the ball, sir?Cornwallis holds his temper. CORNWALLIS Why, after six weeks, are we still here to attend a ball. By now, we should be attending balls in North Carolina, not South Carolina. MAJOR HALBERT Our supply line, sir? CORNWALLIS Excellent guess, Major.The valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at thegarment with deepest disdain. CORNWALLIS And what, praytell, is this? VALET Uh... I borrowed it from Colonel North. I took it in at the back, added wider epaulets, a court sash and looped gold braiding on the cuffs... CORNWALLIS It's a horse blanket. (to Major Halbert) First my personal baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned, a dozen convoys attacked. Colonel, if you can't secure our supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come? COLONEL HALBERT Sir, they're not like regulars, we can't find them and we don't know when or where they're going to strike. CORNWALLIS How impolite. And who leads these clever, secretive fellows? COLONEL HALBERT We don't know, sir. He's called, the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox by others. CORNWALLIS Colonel, I'm a civilized man but I'm finding to difficult to remain civil. Secure my supply line. COLONEL HALBERT Yes, sir.Cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs andstrides out. Tarleton, amused, follows.EXT.

DALTON To hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball... GUARD Give us a nip, here.Billings and Dalton walk over to the Redcoats guards.

BALLROOM - NIGHTGrand. Opulent. Cornwallis speaks with a small gatheringof loyalist civilians, among whom is the spectacular MRS.TALBOT, who wears a daring dress that reveals an enormousexpanse of bosom. At her side stands her toady of ahusband, MR. TALBOT. MRS. TALBOT No! The beasts took your dogs, as well? CORNWALLIS Fine animals, a gift from His Majesty. Dead now, for all I know. MRS. TALBOT Is there no decency? MR. TALBOT Among the rebels? We know the answer to that. CORNWALLIS Yes, we have learned.INT./ EXT. CAMDEN ARMORY - NIGHTMarion and Scott shove their chisels through the doorwhich falls away from the hinges.

BALCONY - CAMDEN INN - NIGHTCornwallis, taking the night air with Mrs. Talbot, gazesat the moon, achieving the calculated effect. MRS. TALBOT You seem far away. CORNWALLIS It's the weight of command and the lot of a widower -- memories, loneliness... (with a self- deprecating laugh) ... and long gazes at the moon.Mrs. Talbot sympathetically sighs and touches herfingertips to her heart which is conveniently locatedinches above her stunning cleavage. MRS. TALBOT Oh, you poor man...A MASSIVE EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT as a FIREBALLerupts from the armory. British officers, including MajorHalbert and Tarleton, RUSH OUT along with Mr. Talbot andother Loyalist civilians. MAJOR HALBERT Good God!Mr. Talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks athis wife, clinging to Cornwallis' arm. MR.

Marion, withthe two Great Danes at his side, speaks with PETER GREEN,a middle-aged storekeeper with a marked limp. GREEN ... four baskets of apples, salt pork, sweet potatoes, jerky, hard tack, salt and powder. It's not much, but I'll get you more. MARION We can't pay for this... GREEN I'll give you what I can, when I can. You pay me what you can.Green's daughter, ANNE, very attractive, around sixteen,joins them. Gabriel sees her and sidles over. GREEN Francis, you remember my daughter, Anne. MARION Nice to see you again, Anne.Gabriel clears his throat. Anne looks at him coolly. ANNE I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea. GABRIEL I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan... ANNE It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month. GABRIEL Uh... uh... I... GREEN He's sorry. Come.Green heads across the square where some townspeople aregiving Marion's men provisions. Anne and Gabriel follow.Marion turns to some waiting men, new recruits.Billings, nearby, reads A POSTED BROADSHEET thatannounces: "Reward Offered: For the capture or death ofthe rebel known as 'The Swamp Fox'".He tears it down and walks over to Marion. MARION ... and your terms of enlistment will be month-to-month. Every thirty days you can re-enlist or return to your families.REED, the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to Marion. REED I'm in.The others nod in agreement. MARION Talk to Abner and Scott about provisions, powder and mounts.The recruits head off.

As white as can be.She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh.MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel someapples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catchingthem behind his back, a cocky move, executed with adisarming smile that makes Anne laugh again. Marionsmiles at his son's flirtation. Billings smiles as well. BILLINGS He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly. MARION (softly) No, he takes after his mother...Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion'swords. MARION ... the younger ones barely remember her but Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth... she taught him well, guided him, she was his North Star and mine... her father was a minister, in Boston, did you know that?Billings nods. MARION ... Gabriel's already a better man than I could ever hope to be...Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel,adopting a coarse, joking tone. MARION What do you mean, old and ugly? BILLINGS You got me beat on both accounts. MARION The hell I do.They mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind.Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off. Hesays goodbye to Anne, then RUNS TO HIS HORSE, MOUNTINGWITH A DRAMATIC LEAP. He GALLOPS up, taking his place athis father's side. Marion doesn't turn to look at him,but he knows he's there.EXT.

GABRIEL Father, no...As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabrielgrabs the bridle. He YANKS HARD, stopping Marion's horsedead. THE HORSE BUCKS, nearly throwing Marion... MARION That's him. Tarleton.MARION SPURS THE HORSE which tries to respond but isJERKED BACK AGAIN by Gabriel. Marion angrily turns on hisson... MARION Damn you! Let go!Gabriel looks up at his father, never loosening his irongrip on the bridles but speaking softly, almostpleadingly: GABRIEL Father, please...Marion looks down at Gabriel. Then Marion looks over atBillings and the three wounded men...One bleeds from an ugly neck wound... their shared mountsare nearly spent...Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departingTarleton. Then he dismounts and hurries over to help thewounded. Gabriel watches his father for a moment, thenjoins him with the wounded.EXT. WOODED GLEN - NIGHTDark. Marion and his battered men gather, taking stock.Men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, pastwary sentries. GABRIEL RIDES UP, dismounts and reports toMarion, out of earshot of the other men. GABRIEL Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured. MARION I should have killed him when I had the chance? GABRIEL When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family? MARION No... GABRIEL Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.Marion is silent. GABRIEL There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself. (beat) Stay the course.The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words bringsa thin smile to Marion's face. MARION Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper. GABRIEL She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan. MARION You learned her lessons better than I. GABRIEL She got me at a more impressionable age.Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and headsover to help with the wounded.EXT. MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTA cold, winter rain falls. Most of Marion's grim men arehuddled in lean-to's and around campfires. Green andseveral other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon ofsupplies while Marion, Scott and Fielding stow theprovisions.Gabriel and Anne sit at a fire, under the cover of a lean-to, taking quietly. He's troubled. She tries to behopeful. ANNE Next time we'll bring more blankets. GABRIEL That would be nice. ANNE Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow. GABRIEL That would be nice, too.She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup oftea. ANNE Just because the French didn't come this fall, doesn't mean they're never going to come.He nods and takes a drink of the tea. She smiles.Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink-stained, black teeth. Before she has time to laugh...ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP. Marion hurries over,accompanied by the Great Danes. The other men gatheraround. ROLLINS They're to be hung! GABRIEL But they're prisoners-of-war!Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel. He is, however,taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth. Gabriel noticeseveryone looking at his mouth.Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly inthe face of the troubling news.EXT. FORT CAROLINA - DAYA REDCOAT SENTRY sees a lone figure on horseback ride outof distant woods. It's Rev. Oliver, carrying a white flagwith one hand, holding a dispatch case in the other. Thesentry calls to the Commander of the Watch. REDCOAT SENTRY Sir.INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAYA temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeeredfarmhouse. Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailormeasures him and marks alterations on a partiallycompleted uniform. Tarleton enters. TARLETON General, a message from the commander of the rebel militia.Cornwallis reads the message. CORNWALLIS It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley. TARLETON Are you going to meet with him? CORNWALLIS Most certainly. Arrange it.EXT. CAROLINA ROAD - DAYMarion rides, trailed by Cornwallis' Great Danes. Behindhim, two dozen heavily armed Patriots, including Rev.Oliver who carries a white flag.A detachment of Redcoat Cavalry, lead by Major Halbert,waits. The Redcoats fall in on either side. They rideon.EXT. FORT CAROLINA - DAYRedcoat sentries see the approaching Patriots and Redcoatsand open the gates. Billings and the other Patriots stop,a hundred yards outside the barricades.MARION alone rides through the gates, flanked by theBritish cavalry, the Great Danes following closely behind.INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAYMajor Halbert ushers Marion in. The Great Danes followsniffing curiously, sensing something or someone. MAJOR HALBERT Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently. MARION Thank you. MAJOR HALBERT You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that... MARION (interrupting) I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley. MAJOR HALBERT Yes, quite, but you should know that... MARION That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis. MAJOR HALBERT (coldly) Yes... you will wait.Major Halbert turns and starts to stride out. MARION One other thing.Major Halbert stops. MARION The proper form of address to a superior officer, even one of an opposing army, is "Yes, sir."Major Halbert sneers and strides from the room. MARIONALONE, EXCEPT FOR THE DOGS, allows himself a fleetingsmile. Then he looks around the room. He notes a rockingchair. Curious, he hefts it. Too heavy. He puts itdown, sits and rocks. The dogs walk over and lay at hisfeet.INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY (LATER)Marion patiently sits rocking. One of the dogs has itshead in his lap and Marion scratches it behind the ears. DISSOLVE TO:INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAYA stone-faced Marion stands in the center of the room,playing with the dogs. One of the dogs jumps up, puttingits front legs on Marion's shoulders, and licks his face.Just then, Cornwallis walks in, overjoyed to see his dogs. CORNWALLIS Jupiter! Mars!The dogs just look at Cornwallis. He holds out his arms,waiting for them to rush to him. They look up at Marionwho nods to them. MARION Go.The dogs run to Cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendlybut not enthusiastic manner. Cornwallis pats themvigorously, too vigorously for the moderate level of joythe dogs are showing at their reunion. CORNWALLIS My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed. Thank you for that, Colonel. MARION My pleasure, sir. CORNWALLIS Please forgive me for keeping you waiting. MARION Apology accepted. CORNWALLIS Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name. MARION Colonel will do. CORNWALLIS As you wish.TARLETON ENTERS with four Dragoons, all armed...Marion freezes...Marion and Tarleton lock eyes. Marion searches for somesign that Tarleton recognizes him. There's none. CORNWALLIS Colonel... Colonel Banastre Tarleton.Tarleton nods. TARLETON Colonel.Marion, like ice, looks Tarleton up and down. Then heslowly turns and looks at the four Dragoons, two on eitherside of Tarleton. Marion measures the odds and finds themwanting.With a supreme effort of will, Marion forces himself toturn from Tarleton to Cornwallis and the matter at hand. MARION Shall we proceed? CORNWALLIS Let us. Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you... MARION I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled. CORNWALLIS Oh? MARION I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War. CORNWALLIS Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin? MARION Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.Cornwallis is surprised. He exchanges a look withTarleton. CORNWALLIS You are familiar with how these things are done. In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status. MARION Very well, proceed, sir. CORNWALLIS First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me. MARION I will do so as soon as possible.Cornwallis is surprised. CORNWALLIS Thank you. MARION Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner. CORNWALLIS Apology accepted. Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable. MARION That one is a bit more difficult. CORNWALLIS Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention. MARION And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention? CORNWALLIS Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other. There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men. MARION Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children? CORNWALLIS That is a separate issue. MARION I consider them linked. CORNWALLIS I beg to differ. One is a command decision on your part. The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances. MARION As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. (beat) And my men are excellent marksmen.Cornwallis sighs. CORNWALLIS Very well, let us move on to... MARION Prisoner exchange. CORNWALLIS Sir? MARION You have eighteen of my men. I want them back. CORNWALLIS I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war. MARION If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men. CORNWALLIS What officers?Marion steps to the window, checks the view. A woodedhillside is visible in the distance. Marion reaches intohis jacket...The Dragoons move on him...Marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which hehands to Cornwallis. MARION In the clearing, just down from the crest, to the left of the dark pines...Cornwallis looks through the spyglass.VIEW THROUGH THE SPYGLASSThough difficult to see clearly through the shimmeringhaze, Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoatofficers, with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at theirheads.CORNWALLIS turns coldly to Marion. CORNWALLIS Their names, ranks and posts? MARION They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow. Their posts? We picked them up here-and-there last night.Cornwallis glares at Marion. CORNWALLIS You are not a gentleman.Marion can't help but laugh at the insult. MARION If your conduct is the measure of a gentleman, I take that as a compliment. (coldly) Get my men.Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington. CORNWALLIS Arrange the exchange.Colonel Huntington leaves to do so. MARION Thank you, General. I'm sure your officers will thank you, as well.Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute.THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON. He walks up to him andlooks him in the eye. MARION You don't remember me, do you?Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, butunable to place him... then Tarleton remembers... TARLETON Ah, yes, that boy.Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare. TARLETON Ugly business, doing one's duty. MARION Yes, ugly business.Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks verysoftly, very slowly, very clearly. MARION If you are alive when this war is over, I'm going to kill you.Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectlyclear that he means what he says. Tarleton tries to coverhis reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback byMarion's icy words.Marion turns and walks out. The two Great Danes start tofollow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND: CORNWALLIS Jupiter! Mars!THE DOGS FREEZE, looking after Marion, who doesn't turnback. The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis'side.EXT. ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAYRedcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting. Hiseighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse anddirected to waiting horses. Surprised to be freed, theymount up.CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch ofCornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his menride toward the gate.THE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side.Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THEGATES. They do so and Marion and his men, withouthurrying, ride out.Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion,without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCINGWHISTLE...THE TWO GREAT DANES INSTANTLY RACE AFTER MARION, making itthrough the gates just as they're closing.CORNWALLIS, seeing his dogs run after Marion, SPUTTERS,then turns and storms back into his quarters.TARLETON, still off-balance from Marion's partingstatement, watches Marion ride away. Then he turns toMajor Wilkins who stands nearby. TARLETON Take a detachment and go get our officers.Wilkins hurries off.EXT. HILLSIDE CLEARING - ABOVE FORT CAROLINA - DAYMajor Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride upthe wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers thatCornwallis saw through the spyglass. As the Dragoons rideout of the trees into the clearing they stop dead, seeingthat:THE "REDCOAT OFFICERS" are not real -- they're nothingmore than SCARECROWS IN REDCOAT UNIFORMS. There's no signof Marion or his men.INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAYCLOSE SHOT: One of the "Redcoat Officers," stuffed withstraw is thrown onto Cornwallis' desk by Tarleton.Cornwallis looks at the scarecrow, then turns to Tarleton. CORNWALLIS This fox believes himself clever. We shall see.EXT. POND BLUFF - DAYTarleton and Wilkins wait while Green Dragoons andLoyalists search the remains of Marion's house and barn.Gaskins, filthy from the ashes, walks up to Tarleton. GASKINS Nothing. WILKINS No one's been here for months. TARLETON But now we have a name for our Colonel... Francis Marion. And with a name will come a family.EXT.

Tarleton and Wilkinsstride in, watching the search... the parlor... nothing...The kitchen... food is cooking...The dining room... the table is set, half-eaten food is onthe plates, abandoned in mid-meal. TARLETON WALKS INTOTHE DINING ROOM, touches some of the food, gauging itswarmth. TARLETON They can't be far. Check the outbuildings and the woods.The Dragoons race outside.EXT. CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - NIGHTA TORCH BURNS. A dozen Dragoons light torches off of itand fan out to search. The thick fog turns the torchesinto diffused, floating balls of light, turning theDragoons into ghost-like apparitions.CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES, carried by aparticularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge ofthe underbrush closest to the house. As the torch moves,its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into theunderbrush...The CAMERA STOPS to reveal, in the brush, TWO FACES,GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE, dark, motionless, watching thesearch. Behind them, MARION'S OTHER CHILDREN, Nathan,Samuel, Margaret, William and Susan...Around them, SEVERAL MORE OF MARION'S MEN, including ABNERBROWN, weapons ready. The moving lights play on theirfaces.AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE, the torches converge,illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order. Thetorches fan out and begin SETTING FIRE TO THE HOUSE, BARNSAND OUTBUILDINGS.MARGARET grips Charlotte's arm. Gabriel motions and theyall ease back, disappearing into the brush.EXT. SHANTY TOWN - NIGHTA compound of rude shacks, built of scraps of lumber andrough-hewn logs, stands on the side of the Magpie River.Marion's men wait with the children while Abner, Charlotteand Gabriel, flanked by Aaron and Abigail, Marion'smiddle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence,talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, blackFREEDMEN.The conversation, which is out of the children's earshot,is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmenparticularly troubled.Marion's stone-faced children look around, appraisingtheir surroundings, registering the poverty of the shantytown.THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GROWN-UPS ends with a guardedexchange of handshakes. Gabriel, Charlotte, Abner, Aaronand Abigail rejoin the children and Marion's men. GABRIEL It's all set.They follow Aaron, down an alley to A SHACK. Small.Barely standing. The children stop in their tracks,knowing this is to be their new home.Charlotte sees their hesitation. She walks up to thelittle structure, examining it with a critical eye. Shelooks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor,wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude,chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall. She smiles. CHARLOTTE This will do fine.She turns to Aaron and Abigail. CHARLOTTE Thank you.Charlotte walks inside without looking back. The childrenhesitate, then follow her inside.INT. SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHTThe children help Aaron and Abigail make beds out ofarmloads of hay. OUTSIDE, Charlotte and Gabriel talkquietly. CHARLOTTE So he's the one they talk about, the Swamp Fox. GABRIEL Yes. CHARLOTTE I thought it might be him, the bits and pieces we heard, a veteran, fought in the French and Indian War, knows the swamps. GABRIEL They won't stop looking for you and the children. CHARLOTTE We'll be alright, here, for now. (beat) How is he?Gabriel searches for an honest answer. GABRIEL I don't know... I'm his son.Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack andpulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte. GABRIEL These are for you and the children.They sense someone behind them. SUSAN Why didn't father come?Gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from hisheretofore silent sister. Charlotte nods, smiling. CHARLOTTE Speaking for months now. SUSAN Why didn't he come? GABRIEL He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men. SUSAN He left us. GABRIEL I know he did and he's sorry. He'll come back as soon as he can.Susan says nothing. Gabriel continues, hopefully. GABRIEL There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you. SUSAN I don't care. I hate him. GABRIEL You don't hate him. SUSAN Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back.Gabriel kneels down and embraces her. She stands coldlywith her arms at her sides.EXT. MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - DAYAn astonished Marion talks to Gabriel. MARION She spoke? Susan spoke? GABRIEL Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along. MARION I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...The cloud passes quickly. MARION Tell me everything she said, word for word.Gabriel hesitates. GABRIEL She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her. MARION She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said that?Gabriel nods. MARION Isn't that something.Marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself.Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject. GABRIEL Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about. MARION What? GABRIEL Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there.Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel.EXT.

CHURCH - PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHTMarion walks in and stops dead. At the altar of the smallsanctuary, HALF-A-DOZEN PEOPLE stand with Rev. Oliver. Atthe center of the tiny gathering is Anne Green, flanked byher parents. GABRIEL Father, I'm looking for a best man.Marion is stunned but recovers quickly. MARION I'd be honored.They share a moment, then head down the aisle. Mariongreets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father andbowing to her mother. Abner, at the door, nods that thecoast is clear. REV. OLIVER Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony...MARION feels every word, looking straight ahead butknowing that he's standing next to his son.EXT. CHURCH - NIGHTIn the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom saygoodbye to the wedding party. Anne talks quietly with herparents. Marion and Gabriel talk nearby. GABRIEL Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days? MARION Granted. Where are you going? GABRIEL Cheraw Falls. MARION It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born. GABRIEL I know.They're silent for a moment. MARION She would have been pleased.Gabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarilychecking his pack ropes. Anne joins them. Marionembraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss. ANNE I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning. MARION It's alright. I'm very happy for you.He helps her mount up. Abner, on guard near the road,motions them on. They all watch as Gabriel and Anne rideoff.EXT. WOODED ROAD - NIGHTMarion, Rev. Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road.It's a beautiful, moonlit night. Marion breaks thesilence, speaking as much for himself as the others.

They ride on.EXT. SOUTH CAROLINA SHORE - DAYA British packet, a small, fast warship, lies anchoredjust offshore. A rowboat, manned by half-a-dozen sailors,carrying a Redcoat Lieutenant, beaches. Several Redcoatswait.The Lieutenant, carrying a dispatch case, jumps out offthe boat, mounts a waiting horse and rides off.EXT. SMALL BRITISH FORT - DAYCornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him,sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatchrider waits. They're on a hillside, looking over theburned-out remains of a small British fort as someRedcoats pull the Union Jack out of a trench latrine.Cornwallis motions Tarleton and they ride a few yards fromthe other officers and speak, out of earshot. CORNWALLIS From General Clinton in New York... (reading) "... your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem." (aside) He underlined, 'militia'. (reading) "You have spent over six months dealing with a six-week problem. It is essential that you quell the militia..." (aside) Underlined again. (reading) "... insurgency, particularly because of the likely move south of Washington and the inevitable arrival of the French. Militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long..."Tarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show. CORNWALLIS (reading) "... it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your Parliamentary and Court patrons. Only then might you share in the victory, on the verge of which I now stand." (beat) "Your guardedly respectful Commander, General Sir George Clinton."Cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to Tarleton. CORNWALLIS If I fail, you fail. TARLETON Perhaps. CORNWALLIS And if I triumph, you triumph. TARLETON Probably. CORNWALLIS How can we end this madness? TARLETON Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.Cornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply. CORNWALLIS Civility is a secondary virtue. It is superseded by duty. TARLETON I understand, sir.Tarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, andrides off.EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - SUNSETTarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of afarmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedlypicking at the petals of some wildflowers. A HIDEOUSSCREAM pierces the calm.Tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream,then rises, passing several Green Dragoons who wait withtheir horses in front of the farmhouse. TARLETON I believe they are almost ready.IN THE FARMHOUSEBlood is smeared on one wall, where half-a-dozen corpseslie in a jumbles mass on the floor.In the parlor, Tarleton walks past more bodies, includinga dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually overthe bloody bodies of her two young children, both undereight-years-old.In the kitchen, Tarleton finds Wilkins, some GreenDragoons, and Gaskins, the Loyalist Militia commander andsome of his low-life men.Rob Fielding, one of the craftsmen in Marion's force, istied, spread-eagle to the table, showing the terribleeffects of PROTRACTED TORTURE. Wilkins and Gaskins arenervous and apologetic as Tarleton walks into the room. GASKINS I'm sorry, sir. He died.Tarleton sighs, irritated. TARLETON Very well, get one of the others.Gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attachedwoodshed where Billings sits, bound. They roughly grabhim and drag him into the kitchen. BILLINGS Damn your eyes. Do your worst. TARLETON I intend to.They tie Billings to the table.INT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAYSilence. A tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank inthe floor, disappearing into a gap between twofloorboards.Marion, Dalton, Rev. Oliver, and several other men walkslowly through the farmhouse, in stunned silence.Marion sees the body of the mother, draped over her twoyoung children. Marion turns to Rev. Oliver who can onlystare, offering no solace.They pass Fielding's body, then enter the kitchen and seeBILLINGS, DEAD, still tied to the table. Marion reels.EXT. SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAYMarion's men dig graves. Marion watches. Dalton steps upnext to him. DALTON You still want me to give wounded Redcoats quarter?Marion doesn't answer. Gabriel GALLOPS up. He reins backhis lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting. GABRIEL Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it. A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well. MARION Where? GABRIEL Seven homes along the Black River so far...Rollins doesn't pause. He rushes to his horse, mounts upand rides off. Marion and the other men mount up and rideoff fast after him.EXT. BLACK RIVER ROAD - DAYMarion his brigade catch up to Rollins and ride on withhim.EXT. ROLLINS' FARM - DAYThe small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, wherethe two boys, Rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catcha glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade.The house smolders. No sign of life. Gabriel, Abner anda few other men warily ride the perimeter of the clearedarea around the house.Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits nextto an increasingly frantic, Rollins. They see Gabrielwave, signaling all clear.MARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house.Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES. Horrified, hereins back and dismounts, almost falling.His TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead inthe dirt. Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony.Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner,as if he were a marionette, whose strings were beingjerked by a drunken puppeteer.Marion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him.Rollins sees them coming. He hardens and strides to hishorse, pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddleholster.Rev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins. REV. OLIVER It's not time for vengeance, it's time to mourn and...ROLLINS PUTS THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER,BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT.Every man freezes in place. For a long moment no onemoves, no one speaks. Then Marion pulls himself togetherand addresses the men: MARION Five day furlough for all men. Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the word. We'll reform at Acworth. Any man who doesn't come back won't be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause. Attend to your families.The men mount up. Marion and Gabriel ride off together.EXT. PEMBROKE - NIGHTMarion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up. Thethree of them ride off, pulling a line of horses, someheavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but emptymounts.EXT. SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHTDark. Quiet. Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows whileMarion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walksslowly toward the shack.He warily checks every shadow. No one anywhere. Then aSOUND -- A SQUEAL OF LAUGHTER, immediately followed by: MARGARET (O.S.) It's him! I told you it was him!MARION'S CHILDREN RACE OUT OF THE SHADOWS to Marion. He'spractically bowled over as Margaret, Nathan, Samuel andWilliam fling themselves into his arms. NATHAN Father! WILLIAM Papa...CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunionas Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hugall of them at once as they cling to him as if they'llnever let go. MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over theheads of the children. MARION Thank you.Charlotte smiles. Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking outfrom behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt. Hekneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn'tmove.He smiles to her and speaks softly: MARION Susan...She looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip onCharlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her. Marionlooks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance.Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embracesof his other children.EXT. CHERAW FALLS PATH - NIGHTMarion rides, leading his children, Charlotte and Anne upa steep, narrow path that cuts through a heavily woodedhillside.EXT. CHERAW FALLS - NIGHTThe remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm.

A SOFT WIND WHISTLES ANDWHISPERS through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of thestructure.Marion rides up to the edge of the clearing. AMOCKINGBIRD SCREECHES nearby, startling him. He looksback at the children, worried, anticipating a negativereaction. Margaret smiles and turns to the otherchildren, speaking for Marion's benefit. MARGARET I told you, things would get better.The children smile and dismount.INT. TOBACCO SHED - NIGHTPOURING RAIN. The ceiling drips. Marion lies, awake,with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one ofthe few dry spots. They're covered with tattered quilts.On the other side of the children, Charlotte is alsoawake. She and Marion exchange a long, silent look in thedarkness, over the heads of the sleeping children.EXT. WATERFALL OVERLOOK - DAYMarion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathanand Samuel. They listen carefully. MARION The overlook, up there should be where you post the watch. Work out a schedule. Short watches, especially at night. (pointing) If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms. (motioning for them to follow) Now let's find someplace to cache extra weapons...They follow Marion like soldiers.EXT. CHERAW FALLS - DAYMarion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair.

William. MARIONYELLS William SQUEALS IN DELIGHT, then chases his fatheraround the corner, tagging him. They laugh. Marioncovers his eyes and William dashes off to hide.EXT. CHERAW FALLS - RIVERSIDE - DAYMarion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoidslooking at him. Using the knife we've seen him use inbattle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them.

She just stares at him.Marion stands and turns to Charlotte. MARION Goodbye, Charlotte. CHARLOTTE Goodbye.They embrace. Though the hug is chaste, their eyes tell adifferent story.

Gabriel walks up behind him. GABRIEL Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness? MARION You know what happened. GABRIEL No, I don't. MARION Everyone knows. It's what made me a hero. Me, Harry Lee, all of us. I got a medal. Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes. Everyone knows what happened. GABRIEL Tell me what everyone doesn't know. MARION And what do they know? GABRIEL That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation. MARION That's right. GABRIEL That's not enough. Tell me. MARION Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born. I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.Marion shakes his head to himself. MARION That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect. GABRIEL I'm not my mother. I can't have the respect without the knowing.Marion's quiet for a moment. Then he speaks: MARION It was in '63. It was a bad time. The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge. All the English settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it. We were sent in relief. Harry Lee, Billings, sixty of us. We already had something of a reputation for being... harsh. When we got there the fort was abandoned. Not a French soldier or Cherokee anywhere. They had left a week earlier. What we found was... bad.Marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad. MARION They had left the settlers there. The men had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes.Marion's silent for a moment. MARION We buried them, then we went to track. It was a cold trail and they were moving fast. We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford. GABRIEL Go on. MARION We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort. It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two. We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. (beat) The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee. (beat) The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight. (beat) That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.Gabriel is silent. Marion looks at him closely. MARION It was a different time, son. And you're a better man than that. GABRIEL I see, do as I say, not as I do. MARION Yes.They hear HORSES HOOVES. Abner rides in from the oppositeside of the village from the church, not having seen theresults of the massacre. Excited, he dismounts. ABNER THEY'RE HERE! CONTINENTALS, THEY'RE HERE!Marion and Gabriel just look at him. Abner is confused bytheir reaction.

Finding Marion's weapon'sbelt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds thepaint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS' LEADSOLDIERS. As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behindhim. MARION If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well. Stay the course. GABRIEL As you did at Fort Wilderness?Before Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TOTHEM. He dismounts, excited, voluble. He strides over,pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel'smood. LEE Look at you! I knew you could do it!Lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull. LEE We have a chance! Better than a chance! Cornwallis is running to the Chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at Yorktown. I wish I could see his face when he sees a dozen French ships floating there. And Washington should be a day or two behind him. (beat) And on top of everything, I have a son! Born last month in Alexandria.Gabriel rises and walks away. Lee finally tunes into thepall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel.He turns to Marion. MARION His wife was killed yesterday.

WASHINGTON For those of you who don't know, we intercepted a British dispatch this morning. General Clinton has sailed from New York to relieve Cornwallis.That hits Washington's officers hard. HAMILTON How long before they arrive? WASHINGTON Less than a week. Sixteen ships and over nine thousand Redcoats. LAFAYETTE Sooner or later that message will get through to Cornwallis. PINKNEY And when it does, he'll just wait us out. WASHINGTON And when the British ships arrive, the French ships will flee. And when the French ships flee, General Rochambeau and the French troops will flee as well.Marion speaks up. MARION Then you must let the message go through.They all turn to Marion, most of them looking at him as ifhe's insane. WASHINGTON If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait. He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that. MARION No, he won't. There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory. (beat) If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it. WASHINGTON And what is the second thing?Marion pulls Cornwallis' journal out of his haversack andleafs through it. MARION I'll let him tell you himself... (reading) "... but it is this colonial militia that is the most irksome. Not worthy of my attention, but demanding it; not worthy of British blood, but taking it; and not worthy of a soldier's honor, but sullying it. Those nights of mine that are not sleepless, are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge on the heels of fleeing farmers..."Marion closes the journal. MARION He has no respect for citizen soldiers. That's your bait... militia.Washington nods, considering it.EXT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN - EVENINGUnder fire. Cornwallis and his staff.

They quickly gather around. MARION The British army believes in officers. I believe in soldiers. After we engage, there will be no more orders. Every man here must know what I'm about to tell you.They listen closely. MARION We are the bait in a trap. We're militia. Cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers. And if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him. Listen up.They gather around closer.EXT. BRITISH LINES - DAYCornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, includingTarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of aspyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as themorning mist begins to burn off.Through the fog, he just makes out the American lines.
