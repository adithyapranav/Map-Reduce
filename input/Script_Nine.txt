PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAYThe flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.                         GUIDO            You kill your film several times,            mostly by talking about it. A film is            a dream. You kill it writing it down,            you kill it with a camera; the film            might come to life for a moment or two            when your actors breathe life back            into it - but then it dies again,            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,            sometimes, in the editing room, a            miracle happens when you place one            image next to another so that when,            finally, an audience sits in the dark,            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream            flickers back to life again. That's            why I'm secretive.                         REPORTER (O.S.)            So what's your favorite pasta?                         GUIDO            Finally, a serious question.Laughter.

In front of him:AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET underconstruction. A complex maze of scaffolding, itsunfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.Cracked stone facades, broken columns, openplatforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    Alighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera cranesurrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.                                    p. 2Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and putson his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at thestage, puts his glasses down and stands up, steppingover to the crane.Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of hismouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, inevery sense a jumble of ideas.Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in thebucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,overwhelmed.THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES                       GUIDO (V.O.)          Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...          How do you begin? How do you begin          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page          1... Page nothing...In the distance, a figure approaches out of thedarkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. Anescape from his tortured reality.The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She isgorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, hisfilm star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, shestops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,and kisses him. And with that gesture, the musicswells, the lighting grid rises majestically into theair, the gritty soundstage transforms into somethingbeautiful, transforms into the interior world ofGUIDO'S FANTASY.As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowlyappear. They emerge from everywhere. These are thewomen from Guido's life, past and present. Women fromhis films, women he has loved, the sources of hisinspiration and creative genius.A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant womenin Guido's life are revealed, each with their ownpowerful entrance:LUISA, his wifeCARLA, his mistressLILLI, his costume designer and accompliceGUIDO'S MAMMA, her spiritSTEPHANIE, a fashion journalistSARAGHINA, a whore                                       p. 3A dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guidoand he loses himself and his anxiety in theircollective embrace.INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAYThe fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, joltingGuido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylightpenetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figuresapproach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtimeassociate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figureaccompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, anaccountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obviouspunctuation:                       DANTE                 (walking)          Guido! You're here.                       GUIDO          Buongiorno, Dante.                       DANTE          I've been looking for you all over the          place. The set's coming along. How          are you?                       GUIDO          Bene, grazie, bene.Guido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.                       DANTE          Bene. My God, you look terrible,          better go to makeup, forget you've got          a press conference?                       FAUSTO                 (discreetly, to Dante)          He has no tie.                       DANTE          Yes, makeup and wardrobe.He takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.Guido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a lookand a gesture asks Dante who is he?                       FAUSTO                 (overlapping Dante)          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good          morning, Signor Contini.                                       p. 4                       DANTE                 (interrupts)          He's counting costs, you know. The          Bank wants him here.                 (to Fausto)          Don't speak to him, I speak to him.                       FAUSTO          Okay, I have some questions for Signor          Contini.                       GUIDO          We all have questions for Signor          Contini.They head outside.EXT. CINECITTA - DAYGuido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio enroute to the Production Offices. Behind them is a largeposter of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, afailure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guidopasses he causes a mild stir, and many people noddeferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.                       FAUSTO          Yes, but please, please, I think it's          customary for there to be an approved          script and budget before filming          commences...                       GUIDO          Is he going to follow us?                       FAUSTO          It's not my intention to be difficult.          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of          Maestro Contini's movies, your early          films are...everybody loves them          and... I consider it a great honour          for me to be here now... none the          less, I need a script and a budget.Neither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.They make their way to the Production Offices.Everywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAYA long corridor, bustling with activity. The trioheads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there areseveral, both Guido and Dante turn to look but withoutmissing a beat of their solemn conversation.                                       p. 5As they progress into and through the open plan office,many of the crew look up and cluster around, trying toget Guido's attention, swelling the procession,interjecting with their urgent requests.There are set models everywhere, in the process ofbeing constructed, or painted.JACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from amodel, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.As a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn tolook.PIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with theprocession.

GUIDO          I need a cigarette.Dante comes in, closing the door behind him.                                      p. 7                       DANTE          He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.Guido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads toLilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.

LILLI                 (turns to Guido and lights                  a cigarette)          Calm down. Directing a movie is a very          overrated job, we all know it. You          just have to say yes or no. What else          do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should          this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More          extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,          no, yes, no, yes, no - that's          directing.Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.                       GUIDO          That's right: that's directing. And it          doesn't seem to make a blind bit of          difference, finally, what the answer          is...                       LILLI          So please, Guido, yes or no, do you          want any costumes in this film?

DINARDO          But hardly a modest one.                       GUIDO          Films are not modest. They cost too          much, they take too long, and they          involve too many people. So they          should have grand titles.                       DINARDO          And might you tell the press what the          film is about?                       GUIDO          Why? I still don't know what my last          film was about.                       LEOPARDI                 (In a loud aside to                  Dinardo)          That was the problem. Nobody else did.                       GUIDO          Of course I can tell you what my film          is about...I can tell you the story, I          can tell you who I am going to cast,          the music I want to use, I can tell          you everything... but... I... won't.          I'm afraid that if I say anything, the          word might get out to the Press.General laughter in the room. He wins a round, but isclearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, stepsin.                       DANTE          Our next film will be exactly as it          sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit          of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a          woman, Italy as a dream.                       LEOPARDI          Is this true?

GUIDO (CONT'D)          Claudia didn't get the script! Send          her another one. For Chrissake. Send          her two!

LILLI          Well I don't know which scene until          I`ve seen the script, but she always          likes something like this, or you do.                       GUIDO          Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's          wrong.

GUIDO          Why did people love that film?Guido picks up a straw hat. Puts it on his headplayfully.                       LILLI          Oh Guido, don't. That's death.     Every          time we have to start again.                       GUIDO          I'm trying to find it.

Why not dream          up something entertaining, Guido?          Something with music...with dancing...

GUIDO          Apparently she's staying in some          grotesque pensione next to the          station.Luisa doesn't move.                       GUIDO (CONT'D)          Luisa, if I'd invited her here, she          would be staying in the hotel,          wouldn't she? Think about it.

Look, she was worried about          me, she came to see if I was all right          - which yes, is stupid but not, as far          as I know, a crime, and hardly a          mortal sin.Luisa suddenly laughs, disconcertingly.                                      p. 58                       GUIDO (CONT'D)                 (smiles, insecure)          What?

(raising herself up                  further)          I couldn't live with it - the          absurdity of being you, the effort of          having to hide and lie and cheat. It's          exhausting, no wonder you've got no          script, you're too busy inventing your          own life.                       GUIDO          It's finished. It's finished.

Pick up the phone andargue with your lover. No, make him laugh. Make himwant you.   Walk towards the camera as if you werefrightened. As if you were angry.

He turns back to the screen.Another actress appears. It's Donatella. Verynervous. She says her name. Guido instructs her.     Shetries the phone, the walks. She's not a natural.Luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation. Shelooks at Guido. A little smile. He feels it likesunshine. He turns back to the screen.                        DANTE (CONT'D)          She's nice.                       FAUSTO          She's very natural.                       DANTE          Even better. She's a bit nervous          here. What do you say, Guido?          Donatella's nice?Another girl: ALESSIA. Very striking. Keeps lookingout past the camera, getting sotto voce instructionsfrom Guido. Her hair is in a chignon. She begins herimprov, but Guido interrupts her, suddenly appears infront of the camera. Approaches her, and undoes thechignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful andinnocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper. Butwhat he says and how he says it, the smile it provokes,goes like a dagger to Luisa.                                      p. 82                       DANTE (CONT'D)          Who's this?

LILLI          Sounds perfect.                 (after a beat)          The costumes might not be so bad too.FLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror.

Pierpaolo is tender.                       GUIDO          I can't remember how you do this.                       PIERPAOLO          You'll remember.INT.

STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAYGuido is in his element again, locked in passionatediscussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,an actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.The vast film Italia has clearly given way to somethingsmaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and awoman.                       GUIDO          I don't want to say too much. The          first way that we kill our film is by          talking about it. But this scene is          about reconciliation. And within the          scene I would like you to try and find          your way to begin that journey back          towards each other.INT.

GUIDO                 (Continuing to speak to                  his actors)          Maybe it's the most important building          block that we have to begin again...          We start from the beginning each time          and I feel today as if I'm starting          from the beginning. We'll just keep          asking each other questions, and don't          look to me for the answers, okay?On cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him andushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with asense of anticipation and excitement and arrangethemselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loombehind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.But Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the taskthat lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts downhis script. He takes off his jacket and hangs hisglasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the setin front of him.                       PIERPAOLO          Maestro, should I call final checks?                       GUIDO          Yes.                       PIERPAOLO          Makeup, please!
